QuestDB also supports post-trade analysis, helping traders assess execution quality against benchmarks like VWAP and TWAP.\n- High throughput:Ingesting trades and corporate actions for derivatives in real time\n- Dynamic queries:Materialized views to produce candlestick charts and cascading views (1s, 5s, 1min etc.) for historical data\n- Post-trade troubleshooting:Correlates electronic trading and algorithm events for execution quality\n\"QuestDB has become the standard for data aggregation. Besides that, QuestDB has proven itself to be lightning fast, fast enough to help us when providing raw live intraday trading data through our set of APIs within a few milliseconds.\"Renan Avila·BTG PactualDirector\n\n## One SQL engine, multiple storage tiers.\n\nScale fast.Stay open.\nQuery QuestDB's native format on local storage and Parquet files on object storage simultaneously, all through a single SQL query. Data tiers automatically without manual intervention. Open formats eliminate lock-in while dataframe libraries and AI frameworks connect natively.\nWHERE symbol in ('AAPL', 'NVDA')\nLATEST ON timestamp PARTITION BY symbol\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW 'trades_OHLC'\nmin(price) AS low\ntimestamp IN today()\nSELECT spread_bps(bids[1][1], asks[1][1])\nFROM read_parquet('trades.parquet')\nSAMPLE BY 15m\nTier One:\nHot ingest (WAL), durable by default\nIncoming data is appended to the write-ahead log (WAL) with ultra-low latency. Writes are made durable before any processing, preserving order and surviving failures without data loss. The WAL is asynchronously shipped to object storage, so new replicas can bootstrap quickly and read the same history.\nTier Two:\nReal-time SQL on live data\nData is time-ordered and de-duplicated into QuestDB's native, time-partitioned columnar format and becomes immediately queryable. Power real-time analysis with vectorized, multi-core execution, streaming materialized views, and time-series SQL (e.g., ASOF JOIN, SAMPLE BY). The query planner spans tiers seamlessly.\nTier Three:\nCold storage, open and queryable\nOlder data is automatically tiered to object storage in Apache Parquet. Query it in-place through QuestDB or use any tool that reads Parquet. This delivers predictable costs, interoperability with AI/ML tooling, and zero lock-in.\nOpen formatsLeverages existing open formats.
