    "text": "# About \"could not get table writer\"\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nHello, I have a project where I get binance spot data from websocket and print it to questdb database. But after a certain time (like 90 million data) I can't insert with wire protocol. What could be the reason? Thank you in advance for your help.\r\n\r\nThis is the error in the error log:\r\n**2023-09-09T08:00:44.900294Z I i.q.c.p.WalWriterPool could not get, busy [table=`binance_spot~25`, thread=54, retries=5]\r\n2023-09-09T08:00:44.900300Z I i.q.c.l.t.LineTcpMeasurementScheduler could not get table writer [tableName=binance_spot, ex=`table busy [reason=unknown]`]**\n\n### To reproduce\n\n- Create table with **CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS binance_spot(pair SYMBOL CAPACITY 2000 NOCACHE INDEX CAPACITY 512, interval SYMBOL CAPACITY 100 NOCACHE INDEX CAPACITY 512, open double, close double, high double, low double, volume double, time timestamp) timestamp(time) PARTITION BY DAY WAL DEDUPLICATE UPSERT KEYS(time, pair, interval)'**\r\n- Insert more than 90 million data\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- **QuestDB version**: 7.3.1\r\n- **OS**:Ubuntu 20.04(Containerd Docker)\n```\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n## Top Comments\n\n**puzpuzpuz**: Hi,\r\n\r\n> I can't insert with wire protocol\r\n\r\nWhat makes you think that you're not able to insert the data?\r\n\r\n> 2023-09-09T08:00:44.900300Z I i.q.c.l.t.LineTcpMeasurementScheduler could not get table writer [tableName=binance_spot, ex=table busy [reason=unknown]]\r\n\r\nThis is an info-level log message which simply means that one of the background (so-called, WAL apply) threads wasn't able to acquire the table writer. The reason for that is usually another background thread holding the writer. Later on that thread will release the writer making it available for other threads. This should not impact ingestion stability or performance.\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n**emustafasahin**: This error was shown to me after 100 million data and the DB started not writing anything. Even though I restarted in Docker\n\n---\n\n**puzpuzpuz**: Would you be able to share a reproducer for this scenario? Could you also check if your table gets suspended or not (see https://questdb.io/docs/reference/function/meta/#wal_tables)?\n\n---\n\n**emustafasahin**: Sorry for the delay. When I run the wal_tables() query, suspended returns false. If the situation repeats, I will check again in detail and tell you.\n\n---\n\n**puzpuzpuz**: Thanks. We'll be waiting for further updates on this issue.\n\n---\n\n**emustafasahin**: I solved the problem by focusing on the unavailability of WAL workers. I reduced the number of workers inserting into the database and this time the number of workers doing inserts decreased. I have achieved both a more performance and a more stable recording method. Thank you for your help. In addition, thanks to your construction of this beautiful database, our instant data recording situation has become more performant. Have a good day!\n\n---\n\n**puzpuzpuz**: Great news! I'm closing the issue for now. Feel free to write here or open another one if you face any problems.\n\n---\n\n**emustafasahin**: The problem started happening again and the **wal_tables()** output is like this. In addition, the Python QuestDb error \"Got error: Could not flush buffer: Broken pipe (os error 32) - See https://py-questdb-client.readthedocs.io/en/v1.1.0/troubleshooting.html#inspecting-and-debugging-errors#flush-failed\". What is the cause of this situation?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1237\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 11 29 11\" src=\"https://github.com/questdb/questdb/assets/52174044/d85f3fb6-a737-4a29-a2ff-06990022b573\">\r\n\n\n---\n\n**puzpuzpuz**: The transaction numbers (writerTxn and sequencerTxn) on your screenshot look fine: they're equal which means that everything that was written to WAL is now available for querying. The table is also not suspended which is also fine.\r\n\r\nCould you grep your server logs for any ` E ` (error message) or ` C ` (critical error message) lines and share the results?\n\n---\n\n**emustafasahin**: Sure.\r\n<img width=\"930\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-19 at 11 55 02\" src=\"https://github.com/questdb/questdb/assets/52174044/7a6e77b6-0bcd-41b6-951c-0160a5756212\">\r\n",

Reason I ask is that `row.put*` calls do not do any checked as to value vs column types. It is hugely important not to insert wrong value into columns.\r\n\r\nThe table structure type is the same with the value type.

I guess that some kind of caching leads to this issue. \n\n### To reproduce\n\n1. Create table as below\r\n2. Insert some values\r\n3. Run a few queries with different `BETWEEN` timestamps\r\n4.

Don't know if there is another issue because almost 1GB for timezone stuff seems a bit much to me.\r\n- When querying with the HTTP API through /exec the [cairo caching limits](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/issues/1680#issuecomment-993341288) seem to work. At least the RSS only fills up to ~5 GB. Limits do not apply for a postgres client and the corresponding configuration for `pg factory cache` doesn't do anything noticeable regarding the RSS.\r\n- I also created a thread dump but it is not really interesting for my eyes (not a Java developer..)\r\n- The RSS also fills up if I query an empty table. The only important thing is that I use a pg-client and some kind of varying condition (e.g. WHERE timestamp BETWEEN X AND Y)\r\n\r\nI probably forgot some things.. If you need the raw dumps or memory + cpu profile we should maybe switch to slack :-)\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.. I will try to do some more research in the next few days.\n\n---\n\n**timscchao**: Hi,\r\n\r\nI got similar issue on questDB with Grafana.\r\nThe java process's VSZ & RSS keep increasing when I reload the dashboard.\r\n(no any new data be insert when test the query)\r\nAnd finaly it cause the system oom-kill.\r\n\r\nHere is the 'ps' output\r\nVSZ          RSS\r\n7424680   231468 (start up)\r\n9233040   1844888 (1st reflash)\r\n10412944   2894080 (2nd reflash)\r\n11482232   3845540 (3rd reflash)\r\n\r\nMy Grafa panel is a repeat panel with ~20 $beacon.\r\nField 'stype' is symbol, and 'value' is a double column.\r\n```\r\nSELECT stype, value, timestamp FROM readings\r\nLATEST BY tag, stype where\r\n  $__timeFilter(timestamp) and\r\n  tag=$beacon\r\n```\r\n\r\nMy Env:\r\n- Ubuntu 20.04.3\r\n- QuestDB 6.1.3 on Docker\r\n- Grafana 8.3.3 on Docker\r\n",

    "text": "# function.cursorClosed() not called consistently\n\n### To reproduce\n\nThe `function.cursorClosed()` lifecycle method, introduced in [#4633](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4633), is intended to notify a function that its associated cursor has been closed.\n\n## The Problem\nCurrently, this notification is only triggered for virtual record cursors. This implementation is incomplete because other cursor types, such as those used in GROUP BY operations, do not call it.\n\nFor example, `JsonExtractFunction.cursorClosed()` is never invoked in the `ParallelGroupByFuzzTest#testParallelJsonKeyGroupBy()` test.\n\n## Impact\nThis inconsistency leads to resource leaks. The `json_extract()` function, for instance, relies on this method to release a 1 MB memory buffer. When a cursor using this function is closed without the notification, the memory is not freed. This issue is amplified in parallel GROUP BY scenarios where the function and its memory buffer are cloned. The buffer is free-d only after the whole cursor factory is closed - that's why it was not caught by memory leak guards. \n\n### QuestDB version:\n8.3.3\n\n## Top Comments\n\n**itsaxat7479**:  Potential Solution Proposal\nThanks for reporting this important issue. A potential solution to ensure cursorClosed() is consistently invoked across all cursor types—including those used in GROUP BY operations—could be:\n\nCentralize cursorClosed() Invocation:\n\nIntroduce a unified cursor wrapper or decorator pattern around all cursor types.\n\nThis wrapper should ensure that cursorClosed() is always called in the close() method, regardless of the cursor's origin (virtual or real).\n\nUpdate GroupByRecordCursorFactory:\n\nModify factories like ParallelGroupByRecordCursorFactory to explicitly call cursorClosed() on all associated function instances during shutdown or cleanup phases.\n\nEnhance Test Coverage:\n\nAdd a test case (e.g. testCursorClosedIsCalledForAllCursors()) that uses mock functions with logging in cursorClosed() to assert they are properly notified.\n\nThis can catch regressions early.\n\nConsider Buffer Reference Counting:\n\nIf multiple cloned cursors share a buffer, implement a reference count mechanism to ensure the buffer is freed only after all cursors are closed and cursorClosed() has been triggered.\n\nThis would not only fix memory leaks in json_extract() but also make the lifecycle management more robust and extensible for future function types.\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Ritikdhanotiya07**: //1. Utility Function to Notify All Functions\njava\nCopy\nEdit\npublic class FunctionUtils {\n    public static void notifyFunctionsCursorClosed(List<? extends Function> functions) {\n        for (Function function : functions) {\n            function.cursorClosed();\n        }\n    }\n}\n//2. Modify GroupByRecordCursorFactory.java\njava\nCopy\nEdit\n@Override\npublic void close() {\n    super.close(); // existing close logic\n    FunctionUtils.notifyFunctionsCursorClosed(this.functions); // new line\n}\n3.

Update JsonExtractFunction.java\n public class JsonExtractFunction extends AbstractFunction {\n    private long buffer = 0;\n    private static final int BUFFER_SIZE = 1024 * 1024;\n\n    public JsonExtractFunction(...) {\n        this.buffer = Unsafe.malloc(BUFFER_SIZE);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void cursorClosed() {\n        if (buffer != 0) {\n            Unsafe.free(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);\n            buffer = 0;\n        }\n    }\n}\n6. Add Validation in ParallelGroupByFuzzTest.java\n @Test\npublic void testParallelJsonKeyGroupBy() {\n    // setup test\n    AtomicBoolean cursorClosedCalled = new AtomicBoolean(false);\n\n    JsonExtractFunction testFunc = new JsonExtractFunction() {\n        @Override\n        public void cursorClosed() {\n            cursorClosedCalled.set(true);\n            super.cursorClosed();\n        }\n    };\n\n    // execute group by using testFunc...\n    \n    assertTrue(\"Function.cursorClosed was not called!\", cursorClosedCalled.get());\n}\n\n\n7. \n\n---\n\n**Techo-Minds**: Proposed Solution\n1. Extend Base Cursor Implementations\nUpdate all key RecordCursor implementations that internally use Function objects to call cursorClosed() on them in their close() method.\n\nFor example:\n\n🔧 In GroupByRecordCursor.java:\n@Override\npublic void close() {\n    try {\n        // Close internal cursors as usual\n        if (baseCursor != null) {\n            baseCursor.close();\n        }\n    } finally {\n        // Add this block\n        for (int i = 0; i < recordFunctions.size(); i++) {\n            Function function = recordFunctions.getQuick(i);\n            if (function != null) {\n                function.cursorClosed();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n⚠️ Important: This must be done recursively for any cursor that wraps or delegates to other cursors.\n\n2. Add Utility Method for Function Cleanup\nTo avoid duplicating the function-closing logic across cursor types, consider a utility method like:\n\npublic static void closeFunctionsQuietly(ObjList<Function> functions) {\n    for (int i = 0, n = functions.size(); i < n; i++) {\n        Function f = functions.getQuick(i);\n        if (f != null) {\n            try {\n                f.cursorClosed();\n            } catch (Throwable ignore) {\n                // Optionally log this\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nUse it in close() methods for all cursor classes that manage Function lists.\n\n3. Ensure Cursor Factories Pass Function Lists\nIn cursor factories (e.g., GroupByCursorFactory), make sure the constructed cursors are given access to the Function objects they are supposed to manage/clean.\n\n4. Add Regression Tests\nCreate a test case that:\n\nUses a Function (e.g., JsonExtractFunction) that allocates memory.\n\nVerifies that cursorClosed() was invoked.\n\nCan simulate partial cursor closure (e.g., early exit from parallel/grouped processing).\n\n@Test\npublic void testCursorClosedCalledInGroupBy() {\n    // Create table and data\n    // Run a GROUP BY query using json_extract()\n    // Track cursorClosed() invocation via logging or counter\n\n    // Assert that cursorClosed() is called for each function\n}\n5. Memory Leak Watchdog (Optional but Useful)\nIntroduce test utility that:\n\nTracks memory allocation before/after query\n\nAsserts that no leak occurred\n\nWorks especially for parallel group-by with cloning\n\n✅ Outcome\nAll Function implementations, including memory-heavy ones like JsonExtractFunction, will have cursorClosed() invoked at the correct point.\n\nPrevents silent memory leaks during parallel or nested query operations.\n\nImproves overall resource hygiene and avoids surprises in long-running or high-concurrency environments.\n\n---\n\n**loordjay**: \nAs a result, functions used in other cursor types—most notably those involved in GROUP BY operations—do not receive this notification, leading to resource leaks. \n\n Steps to Reproduce\nRun the test:\nParallelGroupByFuzzTest#testParallelJsonKeyGroupBy()\n\nObserve that JsonExtractFunction.cursorClosed() is not invoked.\n\n⚠️ Actual Behavior\ncursorClosed() is not called for cursors associated with GROUP BY operations.\n\nThe 1MB memory buffer allocated by json_extract() is not released at the function level.\n\nThe buffer is only freed when the entire cursor factory is closed, masking the issue in leak detection tools.\n\n✅ Expected Behavior\nFunction.cursorClosed() should be invoked consistently across all cursor types, not just virtual record cursors.\n\nResources (e.g., memory buffers) managed by the function should be released as soon as the associated cursor is closed.\n\n📈 Impact\nMemory buffers allocated in json_extract() are not promptly released.\n\nIn parallel GROUP BY scenarios, functions (and their buffers) are cloned, amplifying memory usage.\n\nThis leads to hidden memory leaks in long-running or concurrent workloads.\n\nResource cleanup becomes dependent on full factory shutdown rather than clean function-level lifecycle management.\n\n🛠️ Suggested Fix\nUpdate the lifecycle management across all cursor types to ensure cursorClosed() is invoked consistently. This includes:\n\nGROUP BY cursors\n\nParallel and concurrent cursor wrappers\n\nAny internal cursor abstractions not currently supporting this callback\n\nProposed Solution\nEnsure that all cursor implementations—including those used in:\n\nGROUP BY operations\n\nParallel/grouped cursor wrappers\n\nComposite cursor factories\n\n…explicitly invoke Function.cursorClosed() as part of their teardown logic.\n\nThis will enforce a uniform lifecycle contract and enable reliable, deterministic resource management. \n\nfor (Function f : functions) {\nif (f instanceof LifecycleAwareFunction) {\n((LifecycleAwareFunction) f).cursorClosed();\n}\n}\n\nImpact\nMemory Leaks:\nThe json_extract() function allocates a 1 MB buffer per instance. Without cursorClosed() being called, this buffer is not released.\n\nParallel Amplification:\nIn parallel GROUP BY queries, the function (and its buffer) is cloned multiple times. As a result, memory usage grows rapidly.\n\nDelayed Cleanup:\nSince cursorClosed() is not invoked, the buffer is only released when the entire cursor factory is closed. This delayed release bypasses memory leak guards and obscures the problem\n\n@Override\npublic void close() {\n    super.close();\n    for (Function f : groupByFunctions) {\n        f.cursorClosed();\n    }\n    for (Function f : aggregationFunctions) {\n        f.cursorClosed();\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n**Divya857571**: for (Function f : functions) {\n    if (f instanceof LifecycleAwareFunction) {\n        ((LifecycleAwareFunction) f).cursorClosed();\n    }\n}\n\n\n---\n\n**Kishan0717**: You're describing a situation where the cursorClosed() method (e.g., in JsonExtractFunction) is not being called for certain cursor types, specifically during GROUP BY operations. This indicates a lifecycle management issue in the system handling different types of cursors.\n\nProblem Summary:\nThe notification mechanism (likely a callback like cursorClosed()) is only triggered for virtual record cursors.\n\nOther cursor types, such as those used in GROUP BY, do not trigger this notification.\n\nThis leads to incomplete resource cleanup or state finalization, particularly in tests like ParallelGroupByFuzzTest#testParallelJsonKeyGroupBy().\n\nRoot Cause:\nIn many query engines or database internals (e.g., QuestDB or similar systems), cursors can be of various types (e.g., filter, join, group-by, virtual, etc.). Each type may be implemented differently, and unless they all properly delegate to a common finalization or resource release mechanism, some types may skip essential cleanup methods like cursorClosed().\n\nThe fact that JsonExtractFunction.cursorClosed() is not called during GROUP BY suggests that:\n\nThe cursor used in GROUP BY operations does not call Function.cursorClosed() on all functions used in the query.\n\nThe system might only have that logic in the VirtualRecordCursorFactory or similar components.\n\nSuggested Fix:\nYou’ll likely need to ensure that cursorClosed() is consistently called for all Function instances, regardless of cursor type.\n\nPossible Fix Locations:\nGroupByRecordCursor or GroupByFunctionCursor:\n\nLook for the class that implements the cursor used in group-by operations.\n\nEnsure it overrides and implements the close() method properly.\n\nIn close(), iterate over all GroupByFunction or Function instances and call cursorClosed() if implemented.\n\nCommon Interface or Cursor Framework:\n\nIf you have a base cursor class/interface (RecordCursor, AbstractCursor), make sure that close() or a similar lifecycle method calls cursorClosed() on all registered functions.\n\nTest Enhancements:\n\nEnhance ParallelGroupByFuzzTest to assert that cursorClosed() is called for each function (perhaps with a mock or flag).\n\nThis helps guard against regression.\n\nExample Fix (Pseudo-Code):\njava\nCopy\nEdit\n@Override\npublic void close() {\n    try {\n        for (Function f : functions) {\n            f.cursorClosed();\n        }\n    } finally {\n        super.close();\n    }\n}\nSummary:\nTo fix this:\n\nIdentify all cursor implementations used in queries.\n\nEnsure cursorClosed() is called consistently for all function types, including in GROUP BY.\n\nConsider refactoring common logic to a shared superclass if appropriate.\n\nUpdate tests to verify cursorClosed() is called for all involved Function instances.\n\nIf you’d like, you can share relevant cursor and function class code, and I’ll help write a concrete patch.\n\n---\n\n**mitchodvadiya**: > ### To reproduce\n> The `function.cursorClosed()` lifecycle method, introduced in [#4633](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4633), is intended to notify a function that its associated cursor has been closed.\n> \n> ## The Problem\n> Currently, this notification is only triggered for virtual record cursors. This implementation is incomplete because other cursor types, such as those used in GROUP BY operations, do not call it.\n> \n> For example, `JsonExtractFunction.cursorClosed()` is never invoked in the `ParallelGroupByFuzzTest#testParallelJsonKeyGroupBy()` test.\n> \n> ## Impact\n> This inconsistency leads to resource leaks. The `json_extract()` function, for instance, relies on this method to release a 1 MB memory buffer. When a cursor using this function is closed without the notification, the memory is not freed. This issue is amplified in parallel GROUP BY scenarios where the function and its memory buffer are cloned. The buffer is free-d only after the whole cursor factory is closed - that's why it was not caught by memory leak guards.\n> \n> ### QuestDB version:\n> 8.3.3\n\n@Override\npublic void close() {\n    super.close();\n    for (Function f : groupByFunctions) {\n        f.cursorClosed();\n    }\n    for (Function f : aggregationFunctions) {\n        f.cursorClosed();\n    }\n}\n\n\n---\n\n**PrshntP**: The root issue in #5812 is that `Function.cursorClosed()` isn’t consistently invoked across all cursor types—specifically in `GroupBy` and other non-virtual cursors—causing resource leaks (e.g., `json_extract()` buffers aren’t freed until much later).\n\n---\n\n##  Proposed Solution\n\nEnsure that every cursor implementation (including those used in GROUP BY, parallel queries, etc.) invokes `cursorClosed()` when it’s closed. A centralized, minimal fix in the cursor factory base could look like this:\n\n```java\n// Example in AbstractRecordCursorFactory.close()\n@Override\npublic void close() {\n    try {\n        if (cursor != null) {\n            Function[] functions = recordCursor.getFunctions();\n            for (Function fn : functions) {\n                fn.cursorClosed(cursor);\n            }\n            cursor.close();\n        }\n    } finally {\n        super.close();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis ensures:\n\n* Any resource held by a function is released immediately when the cursor is closed.\n* No need to rely on subclasses remembering to call it—covers both virtual and non-virtual record cursors.\n\n---\n\n##  Checklist for Fix\n\n1. **Identify all cursor types** across the codebase (SQL, GroupBy, ParallelGroupBy, Join, etc.).\n2. **Inject invocation** of `cursorClosed()` during their `close()` lifecycle.\n3. **Add tests**, like enhancing `ParallelGroupByFuzzTest`, to assert no memory leaks post-cursor-close.\n4. **Validate memory cleanup** using existing leak detection guards (these were already in place but weren't catching due to delayed cleanup).\n\n---\n\n###  Why this works:\n\n* Centralizing in the base ensures consistent cleanup across types.\n* Direct invocation makes `json_extract()` and similar functions free memory promptly.\n* Tests will then catch leaks early during cursor finalization, not deferred factory closure.\n\n---\n\n\n---\n\n**mitchodvadiya**: Ok\r\n\r\nOn Sun, 6 Jul 2025, 4:34 pm Prashant Paudel, ***@***.***>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> *PrshntP* left a comment (questdb/questdb#5812)\r\n> <https://github.com/questdb/questdb/issues/5812#issuecomment-3041321584>\r\n>\r\n> The root issue in #5812 <https://github.com/questdb/questdb/issues/5812>\r\n> is that Function.cursorClosed() isn’t consistently invoked across all\r\n> cursor types—specifically in GroupBy and other non-virtual\r\n> cursors—causing resource leaks (e.g., json_extract() buffers aren’t freed\r\n> until much later).\r\n> ------------------------------\r\n> Proposed Solution\r\n>\r\n> Ensure that every cursor implementation (including those used in GROUP BY,\r\n> parallel queries, etc.) invokes cursorClosed() when it’s closed.

        "**itsaxat7479**:  Potential Solution Proposal\nThanks for reporting this important issue. A potential solution to ensure cursorClosed() is consistently invoked across all cursor types—including those used in GROUP BY operations—could be:\n\nCentralize cursorClosed() Invocation:\n\nIntroduce a unified cursor wrapper or decorator pattern around all cursor types.\n\nThis wrapper should ensure that cursorClosed() is always called in the close() method, regardless of the cursor's origin (virtual or real).\n\nUpdate GroupByRecordCursorFactory:\n\nModify factories like ParallelGroupByRecordCursorFactory to explicitly call cursorClosed() on all associated function instances during shutdown or cleanup phases.\n\nEnhance Test Coverage:\n\nAdd a test case (e.g. testCursorClosedIsCalledForAllCursors()) that uses mock functions with logging in cursorClosed() to assert they are properly notified.\n\nThis can catch regressions early.\n\nConsider Buffer Reference Counting:\n\nIf multiple cloned cursors share a buffer, implement a reference count mechanism to ensure the buffer is freed only after all cursors are closed and cursorClosed() has been triggered.\n\nThis would not only fix memory leaks in json_extract() but also make the lifecycle management more robust and extensible for future function types.\n\n",

",
        "**Techo-Minds**: Proposed Solution\n1. Extend Base Cursor Implementations\nUpdate all key RecordCursor implementations that internally use Function objects to call cursorClosed() on them in their close() method.\n\nFor example:\n\n🔧 In GroupByRecordCursor.java:\n@Override\npublic void close() {\n    try {\n        // Close internal cursors as usual\n        if (baseCursor != null) {\n            baseCursor.close();\n        }\n    } finally {\n        // Add this block\n        for (int i = 0; i < recordFunctions.size(); i++) {\n            Function function = recordFunctions.getQuick(i);\n            if (function != null) {\n                function.cursorClosed();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n⚠️ Important: This must be done recursively for any cursor that wraps or delegates to other cursors.\n\n2. Add Utility Method for Function Cleanup\nTo avoid duplicating the function-closing logic across cursor types, consider a utility method like:\n\npublic static void closeFunctionsQuietly(ObjList<Function> functions) {\n    for (int i = 0, n = functions.size(); i < n; i++) {\n        Function f = functions.getQuick(i);\n        if (f != null) {\n            try {\n                f.cursorClosed();\n            } catch (Throwable ignore) {\n                // Optionally log this\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\nUse it in close() methods for all cursor classes that manage Function lists.\n\n3. Ensure Cursor Factories Pass Function Lists\nIn cursor factories (e.g., GroupByCursorFactory), make sure the constructed cursors are given access to the Function objects they are supposed to manage/clean.\n\n4. Add Regression Tests\nCreate a test case that:\n\nUses a Function (e.g., JsonExtractFunction) that allocates memory.\n\nVerifies that cursorClosed() was invoked.\n\nCan simulate partial cursor closure (e.g., early exit from parallel/grouped processing).\n\n@Test\npublic void testCursorClosedCalledInGroupBy() {\n    // Create table and data\n    // Run a GROUP BY query using json_extract()\n    // Track cursorClosed() invocation via logging or counter\n\n    // Assert that cursorClosed() is called for each function\n}\n5. Memory Leak Watchdog (Optional but Useful)\nIntroduce test utility that:\n\nTracks memory allocation before/after query\n\nAsserts that no leak occurred\n\nWorks especially for parallel group-by with cloning\n\n✅ Outcome\nAll Function implementations, including memory-heavy ones like JsonExtractFunction, will have cursorClosed() invoked at the correct point.\n\nPrevents silent memory leaks during parallel or nested query operations.\n\nImproves overall resource hygiene and avoids surprises in long-running or high-concurrency environments.",
        "**loordjay**: \nAs a result, functions used in other cursor types—most notably those involved in GROUP BY operations—do not receive this notification, leading to resource leaks. \n\n Steps to Reproduce\nRun the test:\nParallelGroupByFuzzTest#testParallelJsonKeyGroupBy()\n\nObserve that JsonExtractFunction.cursorClosed() is not invoked.\n\n⚠️ Actual Behavior\ncursorClosed() is not called for cursors associated with GROUP BY operations.\n\nThe 1MB memory buffer allocated by json_extract() is not released at the function level.\n\nThe buffer is only freed when the entire cursor factory is closed, masking the issue in leak detection tools.\n\n✅ Expected Behavior\nFunction.cursorClosed() should be invoked consistently across all cursor types, not just virtual record cursors.\n\nResources (e.g., memory buffers) managed by the function should be released as soon as the associated cursor is closed.\n\n📈 Impact\nMemory buffers allocated in json_extract() are not promptly released.\n\nIn parallel GROUP BY scenarios, functions (and their buffers) are cloned, amplifying memory usage.\n\nThis leads to hidden memory leaks in long-running or concurrent workloads.\n\nResource cleanup becomes dependent on full factory shutdown rather than clean function-level lifecycle management.\n\n🛠️ Suggested Fix\nUpdate the lifecycle management across all cursor types to ensure cursorClosed() is invoked consistently. This includes:\n\nGROUP BY cursors\n\nParallel and concurrent cursor wrappers\n\nAny internal cursor abstractions not currently supporting this callback\n\nProposed Solution\nEnsure that all cursor implementations—including those used in:\n\nGROUP BY operations\n\nParallel/grouped cursor wrappers\n\nComposite cursor factories\n\n…explicitly invoke Function.cursorClosed() as part of their teardown logic.\n\nThis will enforce a uniform lifecycle contract and enable reliable, deterministic resource management. \n\nfor (Function f : functions) {\nif (f instanceof LifecycleAwareFunction) {\n((LifecycleAwareFunction) f).cursorClosed();\n}\n}\n\nImpact\nMemory Leaks:\nThe json_extract() function allocates a 1 MB buffer per instance. Without cursorClosed() being called, this buffer is not released.\n\nParallel Amplification:\nIn parallel GROUP BY queries, the function (and its buffer) is cloned multiple times. As a result, memory usage grows rapidly.\n\nDelayed Cleanup:\nSince cursorClosed() is not invoked, the buffer is only released when the entire cursor factory is closed.

Around 50% (out of 1200%) cpu usage. It doesn't really look right and it's not cooling down after a period of idling.

Which is perfect for my usecase :-)\r\n\r\n```\r\nline.tcp.io.worker.count=1\r\nline.tcp.writer.worker.count=1\r\nline.tcp.writer.worker.sleep.threshold=1\r\nline.tcp.writer.worker.yield.threshold=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso i've noticed when i completely disable the tcp line protocol almost all of the cpu usage is gone. Disabling udp didn't make any difference.\r\n\n\n---\n\n**bsmth**: I am going to close as the [suggestion above](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/issues/269#issuecomment-847434873) seems to fix this issue!\r\n\r\nThank you!\n\n---\n\n**jfcalvo**: I have similar high CPU usage values. \r\n\r\n~15% CPU idle after run `questdb/questdb:6.1` docker image without configuration changes of any type:\r\n\r\n![Captura de pantalla 2021-10-30 a las 16 25 29](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/446497/139537088-9c6c4224-8f7a-4d04-860d-7914c3e8875d.png)\r\n\r\nTo be honest it's too high to be the default configuration and totally idle.\r\n\r\nI have tried setting the following environments vars without any noticeable change in CPU usage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nQDB_SHARED_WORKER_COUNT=1\r\nQDB_SHARED_WORKER_YIELD_THRESHOLD=1\r\nQDB_SHARED_WORKER_SLEEP_THRESHOLD=1\r\nQDB_LINE_TCP_IO_WORKER_YIELD_THRESHOLD=1\r\nQDB_LINE_TCP_IO_WORKER_SLEEP_THRESHOLD=1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n**vizovitin**: Same here, and none of the configurations suggested here make situation better for QuestDB server 6.0.9 (via `questdb/questdb:latest` docker image). CPU usage is consistently at 5-6% without any external load.\r\n\r\nTurning off line protocol (both tcp and udp) doesn't help either (and I actually need it).\r\n\r\nAlso same with standalone `questdb-6.0.9-rt-linux-amd64` release.",

Download tar file \r\n2. Extract tar file\r\n3. Try run ./questdb.sh\r\n4. Check open ports - Nothing relevant to questdb\r\n5. Looked in questdb.sh that references questdb.jar \r\n6. Looked in bin directory of extracted tar\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nquestdb.jar should... Work out of the box for RHEL 8.4.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n- **QuestDB version**:6.4.3\r\n- **OS**:RHEL8.4\r\n- **Browser**:\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\n\n## Top Comments\n\n**CJCShadowsan**: And even if it's meant to be uncompiled in the libs dir...

    "text": "# Automatic recovery for suspended (WAL) tables on start-up\n\n### Is your feature request related to a problem?\r\n\r\nWhen data is streamed to a table 24/7 and there is a power outage (or similar issue), upon resume of the server many (if not all) WAL tables are suspended due to corrupt data (I guess).\r\n\r\nAt this stage, the user needs to go an manually perform an `ALTER TABLE my_table RESUME WAL from txn 1231` \r\nAny corrupted transaction will not enter into the table, so the table will keep being suspended, unless this transaction is skipped. There is a lot of manual work or a separate script which the user needs to write in order to get the table back up and running.\r\n\r\nIt will be nice to have a feature where the user can say:\r\n- i want each table to be auto resumed\r\n- i want it to try and add any txn from WAL but skip the corrupted ones\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\nManually resume the table \r\nor\r\nmanually resume WAL from the last transaction (essentially skipping all of them and discarding them)\r\nor \r\ngoing one by one in the pending transaction until the table is fully caught up and resumed\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\nNothing else beyond what I wrote.\r\n\r\nEither way I do not understand why a table will be suspended at all. Surely the user wants all possible good data from WAL to go into the table and the table to be back up and running. This can be automated, so the need for suspension at all is something I do not get why it exists and why it awaits user choice and intervention, since the rational choice (it seems) is always the same. \r\nI may be missing something.\r\n\r\n### Full Name:\r\n\r\nStelian Nenkov\r\n\r\n### Affiliation:\r\n\r\nWA\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\n\n## Top Comments\n\n**siddharth0815**: @newskooler @nwoolmer is this issue picked already? I would like to work on it\r\nIt would be great if you could provide me with the following info\r\n- Which classes to explore for starters\r\n- Any easy way to replicate this scenario on my local machine?\r\n\n\n---\n\n**nwoolmer**: Hi @siddharth0815, here's some context.\r\n\r\nThe table can become suspended for several reasons:\r\n\r\n- database needs more RAM to execute the txn\r\n- database needs more disk\r\n- transaction cannot be applied (corrupted txn).\r\n\r\nIn the earlier two cases, the database deployment can be upgraded, and then the tables resumed. This is currently performed via [ALTER TABLE RESUME WAL](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-resume-wal/). I think the database may try to resume the tables on restart - if it doesn't, then it should, and you can add that.\r\n\r\nIn the case where the txn cannot be applied due to corruption, then it must be skipped. This is also done via a SQL command. \r\n\r\nIn @newskooler's case, he has a deployment which can be sometimes unstable, and encounters corrupted transactions. Rather than having to manually resume the table, he would like to skip as many transactions as is necessary to resume the table.\r\n\r\nPlaces to start:\r\n\r\nSqlCompilerImpl.alterTableResume\r\nTableSequencerAPI.resumeTable\r\n\r\nThose shows how tables can be resumed. \r\n\r\nThe process to resume tables should be asynchronous and executed at startup. This can be implemented using the Task and Job APIs. Tasks can be found in `io.questdb.tasks` and you can search for the job process.\r\n\r\nFor testing, you can use an undocumented function, `ALTER TABLE table_name SUSPEND WAL`. You can also run this with a message on the end i.e `WITH \"message\"`.

        "**siddharth0815**: @newskooler @nwoolmer is this issue picked already? I would like to work on it\r\nIt would be great if you could provide me with the following info\r\n- Which classes to explore for starters\r\n- Any easy way to replicate this scenario on my local machine?\r\n",
        "**nwoolmer**: Hi @siddharth0815, here's some context.\r\n\r\nThe table can become suspended for several reasons:\r\n\r\n- database needs more RAM to execute the txn\r\n- database needs more disk\r\n- transaction cannot be applied (corrupted txn).\r\n\r\nIn the earlier two cases, the database deployment can be upgraded, and then the tables resumed. This is currently performed via [ALTER TABLE RESUME WAL](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-resume-wal/). I think the database may try to resume the tables on restart - if it doesn't, then it should, and you can add that.\r\n\r\nIn the case where the txn cannot be applied due to corruption, then it must be skipped. This is also done via a SQL command. \r\n\r\nIn @newskooler's case, he has a deployment which can be sometimes unstable, and encounters corrupted transactions. Rather than having to manually resume the table, he would like to skip as many transactions as is necessary to resume the table.\r\n\r\nPlaces to start:\r\n\r\nSqlCompilerImpl.alterTableResume\r\nTableSequencerAPI.resumeTable\r\n\r\nThose shows how tables can be resumed. \r\n\r\nThe process to resume tables should be asynchronous and executed at startup. This can be implemented using the Task and Job APIs. Tasks can be found in `io.questdb.tasks` and you can search for the job process.\r\n\r\nFor testing, you can use an undocumented function, `ALTER TABLE table_name SUSPEND WAL`. You can also run this with a message on the end i.e `WITH \"message\"`. This requires you to add the `dev.mode.enabled` property to your `server.conf`.\r\n\r\nFor testing resuming corrupted transactions, you can suspend the table, then truncate or add garbage to the `_txn` file. This should be thoroughly tested.\r\n\r\nHope this helps!",

    "text": "# PostgreSQL client interface errors\n\n### To reproduce\n\nTo create and init a sample table:\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE bugtest(\r\n  timestamp TIMESTAMP,\r\n  symbol SYMBOL,\r\n  price DOUBLE,\r\n  amount DOUBLE\r\n  ) TIMESTAMP(timestamp)\r\nPARTITION BY DAY;\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO bugtest\r\nVALUES\r\n    ('2021-10-05T11:31:35.878Z', 'AAPL', 245, 123.4),\r\n    ('2021-10-05T12:31:35.878Z', 'AAPL', 245, 123.3),\r\n    ('2021-10-05T13:31:35.878Z', 'AAPL', 250, 123.1),\r\n    ('2021-10-05T14:31:35.878Z', 'AAPL', 250, 123.0);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem appears sometime, randomly, when query from a client using PostgreSQL driver (exposed at port 8812 in the docker image). Sometimes I get no data or seemingly corrupted data (at least with more elaborate queries), the other times I get the correct answer.\r\n\r\nI tried CLI tool \"psql\" from an ubuntu machine many times:\r\n```bash\r\nwhile :\r\ndo\r\n    psql -d \"$ConnectionString\" -c \"SELECT 1 FROM bugtest\"\r\ndone\r\n```\r\nI also tried python driver from a windows machine (conda installation) with the following script:\r\n```python\r\n# script.py\r\nimport os\r\nimport psycopg2\r\n\r\nquest_connection_string = os.environ.get(\"ConnectionString\")\r\nquery = \"SELECT 1 FROM bugtest\"\r\n\r\nwith psycopg2.connect(quest_connection_string) as conn:\r\n    with conn.cursor() as cursor:\r\n        cursor.execute(query)\r\n        response = cursor.fetchall()\r\n        print(response)\r\n```\r\nagain, the effect is visible only sometimes, therefore I do:\r\n```bash\r\nwhile :\r\ndo\r\n    python script.py\r\ndone\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional info\r\n\r\n- The query `SELECT 1 FROM bugtest` seems the simplest I could get to fail. Strangely, if I query `SELECT 'x' FROM bugtest` I never found any weirdness.\r\n- The web interface, the one exposed at port 9000 in the docker image, never seems to give any weirdness.\r\n- The log of the server does not register any error. It even cache the query regularly without anything strange.\r\n- I think I got this error with the latest questDB version, although I am not able to prove it did not existed before.\r\n\r\nCould this be a bug of the questDB server?\r\n\r\n\n\n### QuestDB version:\n\n8.2.0\n\n### OS, in case of Docker specify Docker and the Host OS:\n\nUbuntu 24.04 (docker)\n\n### File System, in case of Docker specify Host File System:\n\nzfs\n\n### Full Name:\n\nMarco Trevisiol\n\n### Affiliation:\n\nDeimos\n\n### Have you followed Linux, MacOs kernel configuration steps to increase Maximum open files and Maximum virtual memory areas limit?\n\n- [X] Yes, I have\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_\n\n## Top Comments\n\n**enricobenedos**: @mtopolnik, resuming from Slack, we tried with a cleaned instance without using ZFS and we aren't able to reproduce it. \r\nSystem wasn't in idle but it was with low load. Configuration is the default one. But our production instance have been updated more times since the installation.\n\n---\n\n**mtopolnik**: We solved a number of bugs related to PGWire since the release of 8.2.0. I suggest you upgrade to that new version once it's out, and see if it occurs again. If it does, the fast remedy to try is the configuration option `pg.legacy.mode.enabled=true`. It would be of immense value to know if this config change removed the problem, since it would narrow down its origin to the new PGWire code.\n\n---\n\n**bluestreak01**: i can repro the issue, will keep you posted\n\n---\n\n**enricobenedos**: @mtopolnik did you mean something different from `8.2.0`? Because that's exactly the one we were using with the bug. Downgrading it fixed with no issue. Are there incoming new releases?\n\n@bluestreak01 it would be perfect\n\n---\n\n**bluestreak01**: sorry guys, i jumped ahead of myself here. I used a tool that tampers with network packets, which produced corrupt message. I mistakenly thought that we produced corrupt package, but instead it was a tamper tool.\r\n\r\nMay I ask you to send us questdb logs, around the event this error was occurring? The link with zfs is hard to reconcile looking into network protocol alone. I am hoping for a clue in your log really.\r\n\n\n---\n\n**enricobenedos**: Unfortunately we lost them once removed and restarted with the old version.\n\n---\n\n**enricobenedos**: But this morning we update another time to `8.2.0` and we are able to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nThe log since start of new `8.2.0` container: [questdb_error.log](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17944215/questdb_error.log)\r\n\r\nBy us there aren't logs that show something wrong but the problem exists.\r\n\n\n---\n\n**mtopolnik**: @enricobenedos Yes, I meant the upcoming release that includes several bugfixes related to PGWire.\r\n\r\n>  this morning we update another time to 8.2.0 and we are able to reproduce it.\r\n\r\nCan you please apply the config option `pg.legacy.mode.enabled=true` to see if it goes away? Thank you for the logs!\n\n---\n\n**MarcoTrevisiol**: This is a screenshot of what I am experiencing today\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4be81f3b-e603-443f-85ea-1be33eca2725)\r\n\r\nStrangely, it seems like the frequency of this weird behaviour has decrease since yesterday, so that I took me several attempts to record one incident.\r\n\n\n---\n\n**enricobenedos**: @mtopolnik we applied that. Now we need some testing time.",

Would you be able to elaborate on this last feature. Let's define it and see what can be done. Thank you in advance. \n\n---\n\n**viper1**: HNY @marregui. \r\n\r\nit is for the same use case from @puzpuzpuz above. for example we have two 1.5TB disks. \r\nthe main db is on the first disk in root_dir. we create root_dir2 in the second disk. \r\nthen we shut down the database, create the symlink in root_dir/db/table to point to root_dir2/db/table.\r\n\r\nthe extension is, instead of shutting down the database and manually creating the symlink:\r\n1. define root_dir2 in the config. for example something like cairo.archive_dir=root_dir2/db\r\n2. CREATE ARCHIVE TABLE understands that the table should be created in root_dir2 instead of root_dir\r\n\r\nnothing more than that. the benefit is it allows the same functionality with no database downtime and no manual filesystem changes, especially if additional tables need to be created on the second disk\n\n---\n\n**marregui**: I suppose a more general solution would be to extend the create table statement so that it supports:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE table_name ( ... ) PARTITION BY ... WITH .... IN VOLUME '/path/to/wherever/you/want'\r\n```\r\n\r\nso then questdb will create the table in '/path/to/wherever/you/want/table_name' and an automatic softlink \"table_name\" pointing there from the actual database root. Then no config is required. What are your thoughts?\r\n\n\n---\n\n**viper1**: this seems like an elegant solution - more general and also captures the use case well.\r\n\r\n> CREATE TABLE table_name ( ... ) PARTITION BY ... WITH .... IN VOLUME '/path/to/wherever/you/want'\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n**marregui**: hi @viper1 I have pushed a commit https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2710/commits/82e3dbf285774523d7b6cee6632e8d4c1dfed969 with the above requirement, it was very simple to do, that is why I did it. I will add more tests I suppose, and I will get feedback from @puzpuzpuz but it will be merged.",

    "text": "# High Disk usage!?\n\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nHi \r\n\r\nthis is an awesome product, very impressive. I have been trying it out and comparing to some other time series databases as well. \r\n\r\nQuick one: it appears that it can use up a lot of disk space. for instance, I have a OHLCV table with 6052159 rows. I have a date, timestamp, ticker(Symbol) and OHLCV columns. the OHLCV db directory seems to take up close to 20GB disk space. \r\n\r\n- this appears quite high, no? is this expected?\r\n- is there a way we can reduce disk usage by tables?\r\n\r\nta! \r\n\r\n### To reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n- **QuestDB version**: 6.6.1\r\n- **OS**: M1 Mac Monterey\r\n- **Browser**: Safari\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_\n\n## Top Comments\n\n**ideoma**: The record length would be 8+8+4+8*5=60 bytes. With 6052159 rows it should be 346Mb.\r\n\r\nPlease post create table statement and `du -sh *` inside the table directory to find out why you have unexpected high disk consumption.\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n**puzpuzpuz**: You could also try ZFS with enabled compression to save some disk space (compression ratio should be around 2-3x with the default LZ4 algorithm). Just keep in mind that ZFS is not something we have tested and, thus, there is no official support for this file system (however, this may change in future).\n\n---\n\n**Roh-codeur**: @ideoma : sure please see below. please note I removed some dirs from the du -sh output.

Is that correct? The DDL you've shared doesn't include indexes, so that's why I'm asking. Could you try dropping the indexes and check the disk space after that? https://questdb.io/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-alter-column-drop-index/\n\n---\n\n**Roh-codeur**: @puzpuzpuz @ideoma my sincerest apologies to you both. You are right, I did indeed have indices, I was looking to remove them to check the disk usage impact. I will drop and report back. \r\n\r\nqq: do we expect indices to have a significant impact. \r\nAlso, i will try out without indices - do we expect the query performance to remain the same? ",

    "text": "# Unique key support\n\nHi Vlad,\n\nI've recently came across your NFSDB. It looks impressive. I've been playing with it quite a lot and found one potential issue. There is probably a problem with indexing when a column contains too many different values. For such scenario I've tried to use a standard index with the hitcount set to a high number and it made the db very very slow. It seems the db gets slower exponentially with growing number of different items in the indexed column. To reproduce the issue, just set up the index like this and insert 1M items with different unique ids:\n\n$sym(\"uniqueId\").index().size(15).valueCountHint(1000_000)\n\nIt might be a good idea to have something like UNIQUE KEY index/constraint which creates a special index using a hashtable. This would allow user to find exactly one item based on a unique key.\n\nOr am I missing something? Please let me know your thoughts.\n\nThanks a lot,\nJaromir\n",

During this period (couple of days), we do not run a single query.\r\n\r\nThere, we observed that the memory usage of QuestDB rises over time, finally allocating all available memory. When limiting the memory using cgroups (technically via docker-compose mem_limit setting), we observe that the process is periodically OOMd and restarted. Further we observed the following:\r\n\r\n- we do not overrun the DB (all data ends up on disk until last commit before OOM, checked after restart)\r\n- when stopping the ingestion, the memory usage does not shrink\r\n- the JVM heap is limited to 1GB (that could be put into the docs)\r\n- Restarts happen very periodically\r\n\r\n**time between OOMs (restarts)**\r\n\r\n- 03:48:02\r\n- 04:03:43\r\n- 03:53:27\r\n- 03:58:54\r\n- 05:00:44\r\n\r\n**docker-compose.yml**\r\n\r\n```\r\nservices:\r\n  questdb:\r\n    image: docker.io/questdb/questdb:6.2\r\n    volumes:\r\n      - /mnt/db-storage:/root/.questdb\r\n      # Note: setting log-level via env var did not work\r\n      - ./questdb-conf/log.conf:/root/.questdb/conf/log.conf:ro\r\n    ports:\r\n      - '8812:8812'\r\n      - '9000:9000'\r\n      - '9009:9009'\r\n    environment:\r\n      - QDB_LINE_TCP_MAINTENANCE_JOB_INTERVAL=10000\r\n      - QDB_LINE_TCP_DEFAULT_PARTITION_BY=HOUR\r\n      - QDB_CAIRO_COMMIT_LAG=10000\r\n      - QDB_HTTP_QUERY_CACHE_ENABLED=false\r\n      - QDB_PG_SELECT_CACHE_ENABLED=false\r\n      - QDB_PG_INSERT_CACHE_ENABLED=false\r\n    cpus: 4\r\n    mem_limit: 2G\r\n    restart: unless-stopped\r\n```\r\n\r\n**QuestDB output after startup**\r\n\r\n```\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.104203Z A server-main Server config : /root/.questdb/conf/server.conf\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.111826Z A server-main Config changes applied:\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.111843Z A server-main   http.enabled : true\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.111870Z A server-main   tcp.enabled  : true\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.111891Z A server-main   pg.enabled   : true\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.111912Z A server-main open database [id=8916382354024914915.-5271762009964388491]\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.111948Z A server-main platform [bit=64]\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.111969Z A server-main OS/Arch: linux/amd64 [AVX2,8]\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.112352Z A server-main available CPUs: 4\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.112388Z A server-main db root: /root/.questdb/db\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.112410Z A server-main backup root: null\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.112482Z A server-main db file system magic: 0x6edc97c2 [BTRFS] SUPPORTED\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.112712Z A server-main SQL JIT compiler mode: off\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.298217Z A i.q.TelemetryJob instance [id=0x05d6f771771573000001f41cdc0163, enabled=true]\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.307648Z A http-server listening on 0.0.0.0:9000 [fd=58 backlog=256]\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.347898Z A pg-server listening on 0.0.0.0:8812 [fd=62 backlog=10]\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.380170Z A tcp-line-server listening on 0.0.0.0:9009 [fd=64 backlog=256]\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.408147Z A server-main enjoy\r\n2022-02-08T06:36:59.345514Z A http-min-server listening on 0.0.0.0:9003 [fd=60 backlog=4]\r\n```\n\n### To reproduce\n\n_No response_\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nFixed upper bound of allocated memory.

    "title": "Query performance degradation with high SYMBOL cardinality in QuestDB",
    "text": "# Query performance degradation with high SYMBOL cardinality in QuestDB\n\n### To reproduce\n\nQuestDB recently added **Symbol Capacity auto-scaling** in release 9.1.0 which should allow tables to handle many distinct SYMBOL values without ingestion issues.\n\nHowever, in production we observe **significant query performance degradation** when the number of SYMBOLs in a table grows beyond ~1k, even with auto-scaling enabled.\n\nOur current setup:\n\n- ~300M rows\n- ~10k distinct SYMBOL values (telemetries)\n\nTable schema:\n```\n\nCREATE TABLE 'synthetic_table_test' ( \n\tmetric_name SYMBOL CAPACITY 256 CACHE,\n\tdouble_value DOUBLE,\n\tquality LONG,\n\ttimestamp TIMESTAMP\n) timestamp(timestamp) PARTITION BY MONTH WAL;\n```\n\n**Problem:**\n\n- With ~10k SYMBOLs, queries take **15–25 seconds.**\n- Loading a single telemetry (i.e., filtering by one SYMBOL) in a chart is **too slow to be usable**.\n\n**Investigation:**\nWe performed synthetic tests to isolate the problem:\n\n- With only 10 SYMBOL values → queries are very fast.\n- With ~10 k SYMBOL values → queries degrade to several seconds.\n- The performance issue correlates directly with the number of SYMBOLs in the table, not with table row count or returned rows count.\n\n**Reproduction:**\n\nWe created a repo with a synthetic test script:\n\n1. Creates two synthetic table s(syntetic_table_testX) with the same schema as above.\n2. Inserts 300 millions rows.\n3. Runs 30 random queries, each filtering by a single random SYMBOL (e.g., metric_1234) and returning same number of rows (28k).\n4. Collects and plots as scatter plots the two tests as query time vs metric name.\n\n**Result:**\n\nThe first plot shows how performance is in the order of the milliseconds when total SYMBOLs are 10 (so 10 different metrics), the total number of rows if fixed at 300M and returned result 28k rows (28801).\n\n<img width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2595c205-3e89-4450-8fe4-a86382ce4be9\" />\n\nThe second plot, with the same total row count (3M) and the same returned result size (~28k rows), but with 10k distinct SYMBOLs (metrics), shows that query times increase as SYMBOL cardinality grows. **The outlier (>25 seconds) corresponds to the very first query,** where no caching is yet available—unfortunately, this is also the typical case when a user loads a chart for a new metric.\n\n<img width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eca80ab5-3c3e-46f5-9412-42320205b2be\" />\n\nNotice also how unpredictable the execution times are even though the data is synthetic (data points are evenly separated, each SYMBOL/metric has same number of rows).\n\n**Expected behavior:**\nQuery performance when filtering by a single SYMBOL **should remain consistent regardless of the total number of SYMBOLs** present in the table.\nWe tried adding indexes, shelving a few milliseconds but the problem so far in unsolvable if you need to store 1k or more different names indexed with the SYMBOL.\n\n\n### QuestDB version:\n\n9.1.0\n\n### OS, in case of Docker specify Docker and the Host OS:\n\nDocker container inside EC2 running on AWS (amazon/al2023-ami-2023.6.20250317.2-kernel-6.1-x86_64)\n\n### File System, in case of Docker specify Host File System:\n\nt3a.large, 200GB gp3 16k IOPS 250 MB/s throughput (xfs rw,seclabel,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs=8,logbsize=32k,sunit=1024,swidth=1024,noquota 0 0)\n\n### Full Name:\n\nRino Pauletto\n\n### Affiliation:\n\nRebernig\n\n### Have you followed Linux, MacOs kernel configuration steps to increase Maximum open files and Maximum virtual memory areas limit?\n\n- [x] Yes, I have\n\n### Additional context\n\nAttached below the files to execute the same tests we did:\n\n[questdb_connection.py](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22793254/questdb_connection.py)\n[requirements.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22793255/requirements.txt)",

    "text": "# Slow inserts\n\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nHi, I absolutely love this product, QuestDB team has done an amazing job! I do face an issue\r\n\r\nI have a table which has 3 Symbol columns(Ticker, Exchange, etc), a Date/Timestamp column and OHLCV columns. the Symbol columns have indices on them as well. When I try to insert rows in this table, the performance is quite bad, I am afraid. it takes more than an hour to insert 1 million rows. (I commit about 100 tickers at a time, could be between 100k - 200k rows). \r\n\r\n1. the bad performance could be because of the Indices - can you confirm? if so, is there a way to disable indices?\r\n2. I tried without indices on Symbol columns, the query performance with indices is far better - is this expected?\r\n3. I note that the new version of QuestDB is better at handling commits. I have some code to close connection using close(true). should I batch the results myself or let QuestDB handle it? \r\n4. I havent tried disabling indices and reinserting. looks like the only I can do that is by dropping indices and then Reindex - is there another way\r\n\r\nI use the python lib to insert data in the database. even with the above, I cant match the million rows per second performance. I must admit my knowledge of the lib is quiet nascent, a piece of documentation on optimizing inserts would help users like me a lot. \r\n\r\nthanks again\r\nRoh\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### To reproduce\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n- **QuestDB version**:\r\n- **OS**:\r\n- **Browser**:\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Moreover it produces a confusing error message when case is not matching.\n\n### To reproduce\n\nIn a web console:\r\n1. Create a new table: `create table Orders2 (name String);`\r\n2. Try to drop it: `drop table orders2;`\r\n3. It produces the following error: `Could not lock 'orders2' [reason='missing or owned by other process']`\r\n\r\nSometimes it works OK and the table is dropped correctly. If that's the case then go back to #1 and try it again. I'll probably fail to drop the table for 2nd time. This tells me it's related to caching. \n\n### Expected Behavior\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- **QuestDB version**: 6.5.2\r\n- **OS**: MacOS\r\n- **Browser**: Firefix & webconsole\n```\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "text": "# Problems loading 7M real data\n\nHi Vlad, as i told you I'm just in the middle of testing questdb. I want to test it with real data, I mean data we use in our current business.\n\nIn our case we've got a Oracle Database with 7/8 millions of bills. I've got a java program that extracts the data from the Oracle DB and writes the information in two different desatinations; a csv file and a questDB storage.\n\nI'm using a modified version program that i'm beeen using to test other different libraries. The program uses sql2o to gather data from the relational DB and SimpleFlatMapper to generate the CSV file with the data. There is not any problem to generate the CSV file with the 8M of records.\n\nBut the problem comes up as I try to store the data in questDB. I get the error below. I've repeated the execution several times and the error appears,more or less, with the same number of bills loaded.\n\nIn attach, you'll find the java programs i've written.\n\n[f.zip](https://github.com/bluestreak01/questdb/files/335644/f.zip)\n[model.zip](https://github.com/bluestreak01/questdb/files/335647/model.zip)\n\nun 27, 2016 8:24:07 PM jac.f readAndFlushAllFactura\nINFORMACIÓN: .. y en el CSV\njun 27, 2016 8:24:07 PM jac.f readAndFlushAllFactura\nINFORMACIÓN: .. y en questDB\njun 27, 2016 8:24:19 PM jac.f readAndFlushAllFactura\nINFORMACIÓN: Recuperados 850000 registros de Facturas\njun 27, 2016 8:24:20 PM jac.f readAndFlushAllFactura\nINFORMACIÓN: .. y en el CSV\n# \n# A fatal error has been detected by the Java Runtime Environment:\n# \n# EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION (0xc0000005) at pc=0x0000000002c99667, pid=12972, tid=15236\n# \n# JRE version: Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (8.0_91-b15) (build 1.8.0_91-b15)\n# Java VM: Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (25.91-b15 mixed mode windows-amd64 compressed oops)\n# Problematic frame:\n# J 1965 C2 com.questdb.Partition.append(Ljava/lang/Object;)V (402 bytes) @ 0x0000000002c99667 [0x0000000002c99460+0x207]\n# \n# Failed to write core dump.

Often, these lists will be short (<5 arguments), but there is no guarantee that the JVM will unroll their loops automatically.\n\nFunctions that perform relatively simple operations may benefit from manually unrolled variants that skip loop and conditional checks, and instead have a straight bytecode path for the calculations.\n\n\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\nReview var-args functions, particularly those with numeric arguments and basic calculations. If they are a candidate for loop unrolling, implement and benchmark to prove it is faster.\n\nExamples of var-args functions:\n\n- greatest/least\n- IN\n- CASE\n- coalesce\n- ~l2price~\n- concat\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Full Name:\n\nNick Woolmer\n\n### Affiliation:\n\nQuestDB\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "text": "# Worker fences questionable\n\n### Describe the bug\r\n\r\nThe worker contains the following code:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\r\n     Unsafe.getUnsafe().loadFence();\r\n      try {\r\n          try {\r\n               useful |= jobs.get(i).run(workerId);\r\n          } catch (Throwable e) {\r\n               onError(i, e);\r\n          }\r\n        } finally {\r\n          Unsafe.getUnsafe().storeFence();\r\n          }\r\n     }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this is not working the way it is intended to be working.\r\n\r\nIf any of the jobs has modified its state and such a job is accessed by another thread to reads its state, then there is no guarantee that the access happens after the storeFence and before the loadFence. So you could end up with a plain load seeing the plain store made by a different thread. Because there is no happens-before edge, there is a data race.\r\n\r\nIf the job.run doesn't modify any unsynchronized state, then I don't see the purpose of the loadFence and the storeFence.",

It might be more user-friendly to move this toggle button to the top of the page for easier access. Users would find it more convenient to switch themes without having to scroll down.

This way, users can easily access the theme switch without having to scroll back up or down to find it. This solution would enhance user experience and make the theme switch more accessible throughout the site.\r\n\r\n**Maybe like these:-**\r\n\r\n![20240527_144643_0001](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/assets/65233567/dd8179ef-b59f-46f3-ada9-1d49aeb74ea4)\r\n![20240527_144643_0000](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/assets/65233567/21e4d694-ce15-4b7e-9b9b-49b7e1ba29cf)\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Full Name:\n\nPawan Kumar\n\n### Affiliation:\n\nitzpa1\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

    "text": "# Fix escaping of special characters in JSON response from /exec?query=...\n\n### Describe the Bug\r\n\r\nThe JSON response sent back over HTTP doesn't encode certain characters correctly.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a value in a string column contains the char `\\1` the byte value is copied verbatim in the response, breaking the client:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> json.loads('\"\\1\"')\r\n...\r\njson.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Invalid control character at: line 1 column 2 (char 1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, we should escape such chars as per the `escape` section of the [json website](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) and more in detail in the \"String\" section of the [spec](https://www.ecma-international.org/wp-content/uploads/ECMA-404_2nd_edition_december_2017.pdf):\r\n```\r\n>>> json.loads('\"\\\\u0001\"') == '\\1'\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom a cursory read, it looks like all characters with codepoints below `\\x20` (space) need escaping, though more may require it.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncharacter\r\n    '0020' . '10FFFF' - '\"' - '\\'\r\n'\\' escape\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### To reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Insert a row (e.g. via the line protocol) with problematic characters.\r\n2. Query via HTTP `/exec?query=tablename`.\r\n3. Observe parsing issue in client. Python's `json` library seems strict enough to pick this up.\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nCharacters should be escaped.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\n- **QuestDB version**: 6.2.1 (and earlier)\r\n- **OS**: Any\r\n- **Browser**: Python\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional context\r\n\r\n_No response_",

The above can also be observed from the QuestDB web UI as well.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nThe timestamp we insert into the database should match the timestamp we get when we query for the inserted data.\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Arch Linux 5.14.7-zen1-1-zen x86_64\r\n - Browser: Firefox Developer 93.0b9 (64-bit)\r\n - QuestDB Version: 6.0.6 (docker). I've also tested 6.0.5 and the issue is present there as well.\r\n - Postgres driver version: PostgreSQL JDBC Driver 42.2.24 (https://jdbc.postgresql.org/)\r\n - JVM version: `AdoptOpenJDK version \"17\"`\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI have not ruled out whether or not this is a bug in the Java Postgres JDBC driver.\r\n\r\n**Attachments:**\r\n[script.zip](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/files/7230351/script.zip)\r\n",

It's an Open Source time series database that should be easy to try out with your existing stack. Here's the GitHub link if you'd like to check it out: https://github.com/questdb/questdb\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestDB is built from the ground up to be the most performant open source time series database available. Would love to hear what you think!\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nVlad / CTO @ QuestDB\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to hear from me again, please let me know :)\r\n```\r\nThe two links provided in the mail - to GitHub and to \"let me know\" are links trackers. The domain leads to `track.questdb.tech` which is different from https://questdb.io/ that this project uses.\r\n\r\nSo I want to ask what all of this mean?\r\n",

The code in https://github.com/NFSdb/nfsdb/releases/tag/2.0.1 does not work anymore, unfortunately.\n\nThank you!\n",

    "text": "# index function does not work. \n\n### To reproduce\n\n> 1. QuestDB brings a powerful storage engine with high storage performance, but querying data is extremely slow. The performance is the same when indexing is created or not, because the entire partition is scanned.\r\n> \r\n> 2. If the partition data is larger, querying the entire table requires huge consumption, and the officially introduced indexes and practical indexes will not work at all.\r\n> \r\n> 3. It is a great pity that a database does not have an index. If QuestDB does not have an index, please delete the introduction to the index in the document.This can easily mislead users into thinking that there is an index function.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate table example:\r\n`CREATE TABLE demo (\r\n  symb SYMBOL INDEX CAPACITY 256,\r\n  p DOUBLE,\r\n  ts TIMESTAMP\r\n) TIMESTAMP(ts) PARTITION BY DAY;`\r\n\r\n\r\nQuery SQL example:\r\n`SELECT * FROM demo WHERE symb = 'a' and ts in '2024-01-26';`\r\n\r\nAfter creating the index, actually scan the entire partition data of '2024-01-23' on that day.\r\n\r\nThere is no official document shown above, and it is scanned based on the index.\r\nOther users of earlier versions have also reported that the index does not work. Indexing is a fatal problem. I hope that the feedback will be successful and this problem can be fixed.

    "text": "# Add support for IP types such as IPV4 / IPV6 similar to 'inet'\n\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\nCurrently to store IP addresses, I must use the `string` type.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like to be able to store IP addresses in QuestDB using dedicated types so that I can more efficiently store these values and run queries which have the correct semantics without string conversion.\r\n\r\nIn Postgres this looks like the following:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ncreate table inet_test (address inet);\r\ninsert into inet_test values ('192.168.2.1');\r\ninsert into inet_test values ('192.168.2.1/24');\r\nselect * from inet_test;\r\n\r\n address\r\n----------------\r\n 192.168.2.1\r\n 192.168.2.1/24\r\n ```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nIPV4 is a 4-byte host address (`binary(4)`) in dotted-decimal notation  - four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots):\r\n\r\n```\r\n192.168.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIPV6 is a 16-byte host address (`binary(16)`) in eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2001:0db8:3c4d:0015:0000:0000:1a2f:1a2b\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Considerations__\r\n\r\n* IPv6 allows using the two-colon (::) notation to represent contiguous 16-bit fields of zeros. \r\n* Fields of zeros can be represented as a single 0\r\n* Leading zeros in a field may be omitted, such as changing `0db8` to `db8`\r\n\r\nTherefore, the following are all equivalent:\r\n\r\n```\r\n2001:0db8:3c4d:0015:0000:0000:1a2f:1a2b\r\n2001:0db8:3c4d:0015::1a2f:1a2b\r\n2001:db8:3c4d:15::1a2f:1a2b\r\n```\r\n\r\n* The ability to support for block suffixes should be considered, i.e.:\r\n    * 192.168.100.0/24\r\n    * 2001:db8:3c4d::/48\r\n\r\nTo compare with other systems, in PostgreSQL, there are two data types `inet` and `cidr`\r\n\r\n> The essential difference between inet and cidr data types is that inet accepts values with nonzero bits to the right of the netmask, whereas cidr does not. For example, 192.168.0.1/24 is valid for inet but not for cidr.\r\n\r\n__References:__\r\n\r\n* [IPV6 overview](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E23823_01/html/816-4554/ipv6-overview-10.html)\r\n* [Postgres network address types](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-net-types.html)\r\n\r\n__Additional functionality:__\r\n\r\nBy supporting types of this kind, there is the possibility to allow the use of network address functions and operators which are used like so:\r\n\r\n| operator| description|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|<<| `inet << inet → boolean` - Is subnet strictly contained by subnet? (`inet '192.168.1.5' << inet '192.168.1/24' → t`)\r\n| <<= | `inet <<= inet → boolean` - Is subnet contained by or equal to subnet? (`inet '192.168.1/24' <<= inet '192.168.1/24' → t`)\r\n\r\nFor more details, see [Postgres Network address Functions and Operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-net.html)\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Performance issue with NOT IN filter that includes NULL values inside a CTE",
    "text": "# Performance issue with NOT IN filter that includes NULL values inside a CTE\n\n### To reproduce\n\nWhen using a `NOT IN` filter inside a CTE, which is subsequently aggregated with `SAMPLE BY`, including NULL values with `Field NOT IN ('A', 'B') OR Field IS NOT NULL` results in significantly worse performance.\n\nTo reproduce, create a table with a symbol, numeric, and timestamp field and populate a large number of rows. Fill the symbol column with values including NULL.\n\nThen, test the following query:\n```sql\nWITH FilteredData AS (\n    (SELECT *\n    FROM Test\n    WHERE Timestamp BETWEEN '2024-09-29' AND '2024-10-04' \n    AND Qualifiers NOT IN ('Test1', 'Test2') OR Qualifiers IS NULL\n    --  AND coalesce(Qualifiers, '') NOT IN ('Test1', 'Test2')   \n    --  AND Qualifiers NOT IN ('Test1', 'Test2') \n) timestamp(Timestamp)\n),\nSampledData AS (\n    SELECT Timestamp, first(Price) AS Open\n    FROM FilteredData \n    SAMPLE BY 5m \n)\nSELECT Timestamp AS Timestamp, Open\nFROM SampledData\n;\n```\n\nWhen using the `Qualifiers NOT IN ('Test1', 'Test2') OR Qualifiers IS NULL` filter, the query plan looks like this:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b95eebd-81e9-48f8-8e67-87aaeaa1ab44)\n\n(Query time: 4920ms)\n\nCompared to without including NULL:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac2ff741-e83c-4cd1-9bc1-92da5f206d42)\n\n(Query time: 750ms)\n\nFor now, it is possible to workaround using Coalesce, but the performance is still not as good as without including NULL:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ce2878c-1ab7-4310-ba89-787b1a61e2bb)\n\n(Query time: 2660ms)\n\n\nFinally, it appears that there is no performance issue when doing this outside of a CTE that is subsequently aggregated. E.g. running just the FilteredData CTE query by itself takes ~800ms and has the following query plan:\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab509c46-3255-4db4-99e1-188a29ddc803)\n\n### QuestDB version:\n\n8.2.1\n\n### OS, in case of Docker specify Docker and the Host OS:\n\nDocker\n\n### File System, in case of Docker specify Host File System:\n\nZFS\n\n### Full Name:\n\nOliver Zhu\n\n### Affiliation:\n\nBRG\n\n### Have you followed Linux, MacOs kernel configuration steps to increase Maximum open files and Maximum virtual memory areas limit?\n\n- [x] Yes, I have\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",

Spin up a Docker of Quest with docker compose:\r\n```yaml\r\ndb:\r\n  image: questdb/questdb:6.5.3\r\n  container_name: quest\r\n  ports:\r\n    - '9000:9000' # REST API\r\n    - '8812:8812' # PostgreSQL\r\n    - '9009:9009' # InfluxDB\r\n    - '9003:9003' # Prometheus Metrics\r\n  environment:\r\n    - QDB_METRICS_ENABLED=true\r\n    - QDB_PG_PASSWORD=password\r\n    - QDB_PG_USER=user\r\n  volumes:\r\n    - ./data/quest:/var/lib/questdb\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Create a table with:\r\n```sql\r\ncreate table 'sensor_logs'\r\n(\r\n  'object_id' symbol,\r\n  'key' symbol,\r\n  'value' string,\r\n  'ts' timestamp\r\n) timestamp(ts) PARTITION by day;\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Insert into the database from Java (more specifically Kotlin) with:\r\n```kotlin\r\nval sender: Sender ...\r\nval instant = Instant.now()\r\nfor (i in 1..100) {\r\n    sender.table(\"sensor_logs\")\r\n        .symbol(\"object_id\", \"id\")\r\n        .symbol(\"key\", \"key\")\r\n        .stringColumn(\"value\", (12 + Random.nextDouble()).toString())\r\n        .at(instant.plusSeconds(Random.nextLong(1000)).toNanos()) // It specifically has something to do with randomizing the number here\r\n}\r\n\r\nsender.flush()\r\n\r\nprivate fun Instant.toNanos(): Long =\r\n    TimeUnit.SECONDS.toNanos(epochSecond) + nano\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Select from the table with `'sensor_logs'`\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nInsert and select all the rows.\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- **QuestDB version**: 6.5.3\r\n- **OS**: Docker on Windows 10\r\n- **Browser**: Google Chrome\n```\n\n\n### Additional context\n\n[quest.log](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/files/9699523/quest.log)\r\n",

    "text": "# $long index\n\nHi Vlad,\n\nOnce again, thanks for your work on NFSdb - I am looking forward to the next release.\n\nQuick question: Are you planning to add support for 64bit integer index? Current version (2.1.0) supports only $int and $str. I currently use $int but I am afraid that 32bit integer range won't be enough for me in the near future. I was thinking of using $str instead. I've tested performance of $int vs $str: (using an object with int/string key + 80bytes of raw data). These are results of my testing:\n\nInt key:\n5,000,000 items added in 315ms\nLookup time is 37ms\n\nString key:\n5,000,000 items added in 616ms\nLookup time is 38ms\n\nThe lookup time is almost the same, but append time is approximately two times slower - that is why I decided not to use $str.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nThanks,\nJaromir\n",

    "text": "# QuestDB stops listening to ports after a short while\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI have problems running QuestDB on macOS installed with Homebrew. Everything seems fine but a few seconds after restart all QuestDB listening ports will be closed. There are no message in the log / stdout and the process keeps running.\r\n\r\nThe ports will be opened for listening after start:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCOMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\r\njava    10424  gnn   98u  IPv4 0x8fed7be36c0007dd      0t0  TCP *:9000 (LISTEN)\r\njava    10424  gnn  102u  IPv4 0x8fed7be36bff719d      0t0  TCP *:8812 (LISTEN)\r\njava    10424  gnn  104u  IPv4 0x8fed7be36a250b5d      0t0  TCP *:9009 (LISTEN)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut after a short while they will be closed magically without any message:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCOMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME\r\njava    10424  gnn   98u  IPv4 0x8fed7be36c0007dd      0t0  TCP *:9000 (CLOSED)\r\njava    10424  gnn  102u  IPv4 0x8fed7be36bff719d      0t0  TCP *:8812 (CLOSED)\r\njava    10424  gnn  104u  IPv4 0x8fed7be36a250b5d      0t0  TCP *:9009 (CLOSED)\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo no new connections are possible (e.g. web console). I have also tried to deactivate macOS integrated firewall but that makes no difference.\r\n\r\nThe curios thing is that the process seems to be running normal:\r\n```\r\nbrew services info questdb\r\nquestdb (homebrew.mxcl.questdb)\r\nRunning: ✔\r\nLoaded: ✔\r\nSchedulable: ✘\r\nUser: gnn\r\nPID: 11010\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nquestdb status -d /usr/local/var/questdb -f\r\n\r\n  ___                  _   ____  ____\r\n / _ \\ _   _  ___  ___| |_|  _ \\| __ )\r\n| | | | | | |/ _ \\/ __| __| | | |  _ \\\r\n| |_| | |_| |  __/\\__ \\ |_| |_| | |_) |\r\n \\__\\_\\\\__,_|\\___||___/\\__|____/|____/\r\n                        www.questdb.io\r\n\r\nPID: 11029\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n  UID   PID  PPID   C STIME   TTY           TIME CMD\r\n  501 11029 11010   0 10:30am ??         0:23.50 /usr/local/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home/bin/java -DQuestDB-Runtime-66535 -ea -Dnoebug -XX:ErrorFile=/usr/local/var/questdb/db/hs_err_pid+%p.log -XX:+UnlockExperimentalVMOptions -XX:+AlwaysPreTouch -XX:+UseParallelGC -XX:-MaxFDLimit -p /usr/local/Cellar/questdb/7.3.3/libexec/questdb.jar -m io.questdb/io.questdb.ServerMain -d /usr/local/var/questdb -f -n\r\n```\n\n### To reproduce\n\n1.

    "text": "# Cannot drop partitions while inserting data using UDP sender\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nI have a service that is inserting data into quest using UDP ILP sender. As part of our data retention service we would like to drop partitions a few days old. However, when I run a simple drop partition command like the following using curl or through quest's UI: \r\n\r\nALTER TABLE measurements DROP PARTITION LIST '2019-05-18';\r\n\r\nI get a response saying:\r\n```\r\nJsonQueryProcessorState [179] waiting for update query\r\nJsonQueryProcessor [fd=179] Resource busy, will retry\r\nJsonQueryProcessorState [179] syntax-error [q=`ALTER TABLE '{table_name}' DROP PARTITION LIST '2022-08-15'`, at=0, message=`Query timeout.

Create quest instance that accepts udp messages on port 9009\r\n2. Inserting metrics into the quest instance using the udp line protocol sender\r\n3.

Download _questdb-6.0.9-rt-windows-amd64.tar_ from the [official download page](https://questdb.io/get-questdb/)\r\n2. Extract .tar file downloaded in step 1. using elevated (\"Run as Administrator\") command prompt via `tar -xvzf C:\\Users\\<username>\\Downloads\\questdb-6.0.9-rt-windows-amd64.tar -C C:\\Windows\\System32\\questdb`. A prerequisite is to create a folder named _questdb_ under _C:\\Windows\\System32_. I tried other locations too, and got the same result.\r\n3. Navigate to _C:\\Windows\\System32\\questdb\\bin_ in an elevated command prompt and run `questdb.exe install`, then `questdb.exe start`.\r\n4. Verify that QuestDB is running by typing `questdb.exe status` in command prompt, which results in in \"Service QuestDB is RUNNING\". The running service can also be seen in services app and the web console at http://localhost:9000/ is working as expected.\r\n5. Using `netstat -ab` in command prompt check that TCP communication for JAVA.EXE at 127.0.0.1:8812 is ESTABLISHED.\r\n6.

    "title": "Embedded: Very high memory usage on startup",
    "text": "# Embedded: Very high memory usage on startup\n\n**Describe the bug**\r\nI'm not sure there is a bug here, however, when simply initializing QuestDB as an embedded database, a whopping 220MB of extra heap space is used (measured AFTER full GC). No DB operations are performed other than startup and no database is present (empty). I understand that to be high performance might be a trade off with higher memory usage, but it seems like memory should only be 'paid for' if used? Or is this some sort of startup cache that can be tuned?\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Startup any Java (or in my case, Kotlin) application - can be \"hello world\" as long as it doesn't terminate\r\n2. Open `VisualVM` - perform a full GC and note down heap usage\r\n3. Close program, and modify with these lines in one of the classes (ensuring the references are not released of course)\r\n\r\n```Java\r\n    private var config = new DefaultCairoConfiguration(\"./\")\r\n    private var engine = new CairoEngine(config)\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Open `VisualVM` - perform a full GC and note down heap usage\r\n\r\nThe difference between heap usage in steps 4 and step 1 is 220MB (at least in my application, 30MB before, 250MB after)\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nI expected heap usage to be minimal until I performed data transactions at which point I'd hope it would be tunable ideally based on my desire for in app caching\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\n**Environment (please complete the following information):**\r\n - OS: Linux (amd64), OpenJDK 11 64-bit\r\n - Browser: not relevant\r\n - Version: PopOS 20.04\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nUsing QuestDB 6.0.4\r\n",

This can be a problem with nanoseconds support, as in nanoseconds you get to the limit of the INT in just about 2 seconds.\n\nIf I do `SAMPLE BY 3000000000n`, I am getting `the number is too large (invalid tolerance value [value=3000000000n, maximum=2147483647n])`\n\nUsers haven't complained about this just yet, but one user already complained about a similar issue with dateadd, (`there is no matching function `dateadd` with the argument types: (CHAR, LONG, TIMESTAMP)`) so I thought I'd add this here\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nchange to a different unit.

    "text": "# UUID is treated as signed byte for ordering\n\n### To reproduce\n\nGenerate any number of UUIDs and sort the table by that value. The result seems to be in order of signed byte, not unsigned as one would expect. This only happens for the first byte, other bytes are treated as unsigned and the order is what one would expect.\n\nThis is probably not much of an issue when using UUID4, which is random, but could cause issues if people use other versions. For me, problems arose in tests when I was trying to compare the generated values in my Python code with the one returned from the DB and I was trying to ensure consistent ordering.\nI guess this could be an optimization to start from the middle of the value space, but if that is the case, it should be documented.\n\nThis query generates the output below. I've added the first byte in signed representation in brackets behind it.\n\nSELECT id FROM uuid_test ORDER BY id\n\n80000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 (-128)\nbb000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 (-69)\nff000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 (-1)\n00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 (0)\n38000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 (56)\n7f000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 (127)\n\nSince I wasn't allowed to upload a Jupyter and I'm not sure how GitHub likes it if I just append '.txt' (even tho the upload went through, technically), I just copied the 4 cells into a txt.

    "title": "Symbol incorrectly written to table in 7.4.2 when multiple processes sending to QuestDB",
    "text": "# Symbol incorrectly written to table in 7.4.2 when multiple processes sending to QuestDB\n\n### To reproduce\n\n# Description:\r\nAfter updating QuestDB from version 7.3.7 to 7.4.2 using Docker, an issue occurred is in the same table defining different symbol names are incorrectly writing. The symbol is erroneously written as the default one.\r\n\r\nThe write method uses `from questdb.ingress import Sender` and is performed by two separate Python processes. The symbol names have been verified to be correct. Over the past three days, this issue has occurred 3 times, each time after approximately 160 to 240 records have been written by each process. During the occurrence, which lasts for about 5 minutes, almost all writes are incorrectly attributed to the other symbol.\r\n\r\nFor example below, the symbols represent different exchanges, with one process responsible for Binance and the other for Upbit. During normal operation, without any process interruption, when each process has written after ablut 160 to 240 records, all Upbit records are incorrectly written as Binance. It has been confirmed that the sent Exchange name is indeed Upbit.\r\n![image](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/assets/1086156/b617e924-568e-4082-ae25-2882b9714ca5)\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/assets/1086156/e46aca10-c949-4c49-89c9-82e9e60557f4)\r\n\r\nThis issue started occurring after updating from version 7.3.7 to 7.4.2. Only the storage location moved, and the server IP changed, all other settings and envirment remained unchanged.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce:\r\nAfter updating QuestDB from version 7.3.7 to 7.4.2 using Docker\r\n1. Set up two Python processes, each defining a different symbol name (e.g., Binance and Upbit).\r\n2. Use `from questdb.ingress import Sender` to write data to the same table from both processes.\r\n3. Monitor the table after each process has written after about 160 to 240 records. (in my case about 16 to 24 hours)\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior:\r\nEach process should correctly write its respective symbol name to the table.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior:\r\nAfter each process has written after about 160 to 240 records, in 5 minutes almost all records from one process (e.g., Upbit) are incorrectly written with the symbol name (written as the default one? e.g., Binance).\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease assist me in resolving this issue or point out any areas that need modification which I may have overlooked, to ensure consistent writing of correct symbol names into tables when using multiple processes in QuestDB.

While contributions on this one are very much appreciated, this is not an easy frag.\r\n\r\n[`FastMap`](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/c35187666472a18f3bc2624c7e0c761cb20ce45a/core/src/main/java/io/questdb/cairo/map/FastMap.java) is QuestDB's native memory hash table used for hash joins, as well as for storing analytic functions state in GROUP BY/SAMPLE BY queries. Refer to the class' javadoc for the high-level design overview of the hash table.\r\n\r\nApart from other aspects, `FastMap` uses a chunk of native memory as a grow-only heap that stores key-value pairs. Such design has a few advantages, among which disk spill support friendliness. Disk spill is nothing more but an ability to store the data structure on disk when it grows too large to fit into RAM. It's not something unique and can be met in some databases.\r\n\r\nIn our case, `FastMap` could be modified to migrate from \"ordinary\" native memory (i.e. anonymous mmapped memory) to mmapped memory (see `io.questdb.cairo.vm` package) when it reaches certain heap size threshold. Other than that, we should make sure to clean up the temporary files when we no longer need them and on start-up.\r\n\r\n### Describe the solution you'd like.\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional context.\r\n\r\n_No response_",

    "text": "# UNION shows weird behaviour when combined with order by\n\n### Describe the bug\n\nIf we UNION several statements then wrap around a select with order by, the results show inconsistent (and unexpected) behaviour. \r\n\r\nAdding some queries below to show the problem\n\n### To reproduce\n\n1. go to demo site and run this query\r\n\r\n```\r\nWITH full_range AS (  \r\n  SELECT timestamp, galon_price FROM (\r\n    SELECT * FROM (\r\n      SELECT * FROM gas_prices\r\n      UNION\r\n      SELECT to_timestamp('1999-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd'), NULL as galon_price -- First Date\r\n      UNION \r\n      SELECT to_timestamp('2023-02-20', 'yyyy-MM-dd'), NULL  as galon_price -- Last Date\r\n    ) AS unordered_data order by timestamp\r\n  ) TIMESTAMP(timestamp)\r\n) \r\nselect * from full_range\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven if the statements are not in order inside the UNION, when we do the final `select * from full_range` we see results are ordered. So far, this is what I would expect, as after the UNION we are doing a `AS unordered_data order by timestamp`\r\n\r\nNow let's just add order by to the external select, as in\r\n\r\n```\r\nWITH full_range AS (  \r\n  SELECT timestamp, galon_price FROM (\r\n    SELECT * FROM (\r\n      SELECT * FROM gas_prices\r\n      UNION\r\n      SELECT to_timestamp('1999-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd'), NULL as galon_price -- First Date\r\n      UNION \r\n      SELECT to_timestamp('2023-02-20', 'yyyy-MM-dd'), NULL  as galon_price -- Last Date\r\n    ) AS unordered_data order by timestamp\r\n  ) TIMESTAMP(timestamp)\r\n) \r\nselect * from full_range order by timestamp\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow results are not in order. We see all the results from the original gas_prices table first, then the results from the other two statements in the end. If we` order by timestamp ASC` we see the same problem, but interestingly `order by timestamp DESC `works as expected. However, when we do the order by timestamp DESC the console is showing results in white, meaning it is not interpreted as a designated timestamp\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3839/220626409-4cc10e11-fc9b-4c60-b067-2cf9309a0fa9.png)\r\n\r\nJust to make sure it was not happening because the two \"literal queries\" don't have a designated timestamp, I rewrote the query as \r\n\r\n```\r\nWITH first_date AS (\r\nselect * from (select * FROM (SELECT to_timestamp('1999-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd') as timestamp, NULL as galon_price)) timestamp(timestamp)\r\n),\r\nlast_date AS (\r\nselect * from (select * FROM (SELECT to_timestamp('2023-02-20', 'yyyy-MM-dd') as timestamp, NULL as galon_price)) timestamp (timestamp)\r\n),\r\nfull_range AS (  \r\n  SELECT timestamp, galon_price FROM (\r\n    SELECT * FROM (\r\n      SELECT * FROM gas_prices\r\n     UNION\r\n      SELECT * FROM first_date\r\n      UNION\r\n      SELECT * FROM last_date\r\n    ) order by timestamp \r\n  ) TIMESTAMP(timestamp)\r\n) \r\nselect * from full_range  order by timestamp desc;\r\n```\r\nNow every statement there should have a designated timestamp, however the behaviour is the same as above. Order by ASC fails, order by DESC misses the designated timestamp, no order by produces good results.\r\n\r\nIf however we change the queries (with or without designated timestamps) so the UNION statements are in chronological order, the results are always in the right order (without order by or with and without ASC and DESC), but however the DESC statement still misses the designated timestamp meaning.\r\n\r\nThe next two versions of the query (both with and without extra designated timestamp statements) return those results\r\n\r\n```\r\nWITH full_range AS (  \r\n  SELECT timestamp, galon_price FROM (\r\n    SELECT * FROM (\r\n      SELECT to_timestamp('1999-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd') as timestamp, NULL as galon_price -- First Date\r\n      UNION\r\n      SELECT * FROM gas_prices           \r\n      UNION \r\n      SELECT to_timestamp('2023-02-20', 'yyyy-MM-dd') as timestamp, NULL  as galon_price -- Last Date\r\n    )  AS unordered_data order by timestamp\r\n  ) TIMESTAMP(timestamp)\r\n) \r\nselect * from full_range order by timestamp ASC\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nWITH first_date AS (\r\nselect * from (select * FROM (SELECT to_timestamp('1999-01-01', 'yyyy-MM-dd') as timestamp, NULL as galon_price)) timestamp(timestamp)\r\n),\r\nlast_date AS (\r\nselect * from (select * FROM (SELECT to_timestamp('2023-02-20', 'yyyy-MM-dd') as timestamp, NULL as galon_price)) timestamp (timestamp)\r\n),\r\nfull_range AS (  \r\n  SELECT timestamp, galon_price FROM (\r\n    SELECT * FROM (\r\n      SELECT * FROM first_date\r\n      UNION \r\n      SELECT * FROM gas_prices\r\n      UNION\r\n      SELECT * FROM last_date\r\n    ) order by timestamp \r\n  ) TIMESTAMP(timestamp)\r\n) \r\nselect * from full_range  order by timestamp ASC;\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected Behavior\n\nI would expect since we are forcing ORDER BY after the UNION results should be in order. If ORDER BY cannot be used in combination with UNION then it should probably throw an error\n\n### Environment\n\n```markdown\n- **QuestDB version**: 7.0.1 (dev version on the demo site)\r\n- **OS**: demo site\r\n- **Browser**:chrome\n```\n\n\n### Additional context\n\nThis was surfaced at the public slack conversation at https://questdb.slack.com/archives/C1NFJEER0/p1676890276428389",

This could help reduce the write amplification because one would in effect be allowing the oldest rows to bubble to the front and only that smaller amount gets flushed and newer rows continue to survive.\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered.\n\nPushing some of this work into the clients\n\n### Full Name:\n\nErick Arce\n\n### Affiliation:\n\nClear Street\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
