    "text": "\n# Picking the Fastest Database to Store Time-Series Data\n\nSergey Makhnist\n4 min read·Aug 31, 2025\n--\nListen\nShare\nIt started with a simple question:\nIf I take raw market tick data and try to build 5-minute OHLCV bars — a calculation that every trading desk, quant researcher, and charting engine performs thousands of times a day — which database will give me the answer the fastest?\nI wasn’t looking for marketing claims or synthetic benchmarks. I wanted an\napples-to-apples, real-world test\nof the databases that practitioners actually reach for when dealing with time-series workloads. In finance, milliseconds can mean the difference between capturing alpha and watching it slip away. So I set out to measure, not theorize.\n\n## Contenders\n\n- PostgreSQL(row-store, tuned indexes)\n- TimescaleDB(PostgreSQL extension with hypertables/chunks)\n- ClickHouse(general-purpose columnar OLAP)\n- KDB+(time-series powerhouse used in HFT)\n- QuestDB(SQL-first time-series database)\nNote: Anyone attentive will notice that\nInfluxDB\nisn’t included. The reason is that, while it’s positioned as a time-series database, InfluxData frames it more as a “metrics and events” platform (observability, IoT). It’s not a natural fit for large-scale financial tick history, so I excluded it to focus on engines commonly used for market data analytics.\n\n## Benchmark task\n\nTask\n:\nCompute 5-minute OHLCV time series from raw tick data spanning 3 trading days\n, representative of charting/analytics pipelines and intraday quantitative research.\nDataset size\n: 100 million tick records (0.1 billion) distributed across three symbols (\nMSFT, GOOG, AAPL\n), with about 1 million ticks per symbol per day over 100 trading days in total.\nNote: The task is intentionally defined to compute OHLCV bars over multiple days to exercise potential partitioning effects in the underlying database. Since many systems leverage date-based partitioning, distributing the workload across 3 days helps validate performance across multiple partitions rather than a single contiguous one.\n\n## Results\n\n\n```\nTitle       | Runs (3 attempts, ms)   | Avg (ms)------------+-------------------------+---------PostgreSQL  | 3,735 / 3,252 / 3,492   | 3,493TimescaleDB |   967 / 1,126 / 971     | 1,021ClickHouse  |   535 / 556 / 549       |   547KDB+        |   104 / 112 / 111       |   109QuestDB     |    24 / 23 / 29         |    25\n```\n\nAll the scripts used for these tests are open-sourced and available on my GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/smakhnist/timeseries-db-comparison\nSpeed-of-QuestDB vs others (lower is better):\n- vsKDB+: ~4.4×faster (109 → 25 ms)\n- vsClickHouse: ~22×faster (547 → 25 ms)\n- vsTimescaleDB: ~41×faster (1,021 → 25 ms)\n- vsPostgreSQL: ~140×faster (3,493 → 25 ms)\n\n## What the numbers say (and don’t)\n\n\n### PostgreSQL (5th / Last place)\n\nLast place, as expected for a row-store under analytical scans and aggregations — even with a sensible composite index.\nNote: For PostgreSQL, the schema includes an index on\n(symbol, timestamp)\nto ensure\nO(log n)\nlookups, as you’d reasonably do in production.\n\n### TimescaleDB (4h place)\n\nRoughly\n4× faster than PostgreSQL\n, thanks to hypertables, chunking, and time-aware planning. Still far behind column stores for this read pattern — consistent with its\nPostgreSQL heritage\n.\n\n### ClickHouse (3rd place)\n\nAround\n2× faster than TimescaleDB\n. As a\ncolumnar OLAP\ndatabase, it shines on wide scans, aggregations, and compressible numeric time-series. The result aligns with expectations for column stores on read-heavy analytics.\n\n### KDB+ (2nd place)\n\nAbout\n5× faster than ClickHouse\nin this test. KDB+ is renowned for vectorized, in-memory analytics over time-ordered data and extremely efficient time-window operations — hence its long-standing dominance in HFT/quant environments.\nNote:\nIn our KDB+ benchmark runs we did\nnot preload any data into memory\n. Query execution directly triggered reads from the corresponding date partitions. This distinction is important, as preloading data into memory can significantly change performance characteristics.\n\n### 🏆 QuestDB (1st place)\n\nThe surprise winner\nhere, ~\n4.4× faster than KDB+\non this specific OHLCV query. This underscores how far this TSDB has come for SQL-driven, time-bucketed analytics.\n\n## Important caveats (read this before you crown a winner)\n\nA blazing-fast\nread\nbenchmark is not the whole story. Before choosing a database for market data at scale, consider:\n- Ingestion throughput & concurrencyEspeciallymulti-threaded writesat millions of rows/second, back-pressure behavior, and tail latency under load.\n- Compression & storage efficiencyColumnar engines often deliver excellent compression on numeric telemetry/ticks, but ratios vary by engine, encoding, and schema design. Storage footprint directly impactscostandI/O.\n- Query concurrency & fairnessWhat happens when dozens of analysts and services hit the cluster at once?\n- Operational maturityTooling, observability, backup/restore, version upgrades, cluster elasticity, failover, and ecosystem integrations matter —a lot.\n- Feature set fitJoins, out-of-order ingestion, window functions, etc.\nPut differently:\nQuestDB outperformed in my read test\n, but that\ndoes not\nautomatically make it the best production choice for your constraints.\n\n## Where each database can fit\n\n- Large enterprises / latency-sensitive, mission-criticalKDB+remains a strong candidate due to itsmaturity, predictable low-latency behavior, and long track record in demanding financial shops — despite its cost and learning curve.\n- Medium-size firms / quant research / fast time-to-valueQuestDBis compelling as a starting point thanks to itsoutstanding query performancehere and agentler learning curve.\n- Broad analytical ecosystems / mixed workloadsClickHousecontinues to be an excellent general-purpose analytical store — great compression, strong SQL, and proven scale — often a pragmatic backbone for market-data analytics.\n- PostgreSQL/TimescaleDBIdeal when you needrelational featuresand already live in the Postgres ecosystem; better suited foraggregated barsand metadata than forraw tick firehoses.\n\n## The bigger thesis\n\nFor years, KDB+ was the de facto answer for high-end tick analytics. The landscape is shifting:\nQuestDB has now demonstrated it can beat KDB+ on certain read-heavy workloads.\nThat doesn’t erase KDB+’s strengths (deterministic low latency, maturity, deep ops knowledge in the industry), but it shows that a credible alternative now exists.\n\n## What’s next\n\nThis article focuses on\nquery performance\n. In the\nnext piece\n, I’ll compare\ningestion throughput\n(single-threaded and multi-threaded), examine\ncompression ratios\n, providing a balanced view of both read and write performance.\nCode Samples\nAll the benchmarks and examples discussed in this article are available in my GitHub repository:\nhttps://github.com/smakhnist/timeseries-db-comparison\nFeel free to explore, run the tests, and adapt them to your own use cases.",
