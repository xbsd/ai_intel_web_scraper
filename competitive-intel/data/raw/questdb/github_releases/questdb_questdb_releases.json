    "text": "# Release 9.3.2 (9.3.2)\n\n# QuestDB 9.3.2\r\n\r\nQuestDB 9.3.2 continues the trend of performance upgrades and bugfixes, with some additional new features. Importantly, we introduce the new TICK syntax, a compact DSL for expressing time intervals, alongside faster aggregations, improved applicability of interval scans, and fast parquet queries.\r\n\r\nFor any questions or feedback, please join us on [Slack](https://slack.questdb.com/) or on [Discourse](https://community.questdb.com/).\r\n\r\nSee also our _prettier_ [release notes](https://questdb.com/release-notes/) page.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n### New TICK syntax\r\n\r\nThe Temporal Interval Calendar Kit ([TICK](https://questdb.com/docs/query/operators/tick/) is a new DSL for expressing complex time ranges and intervals in a compact, easy-to-use format.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say that you want to query one month of data from NYSE, only including trading days and hours. The data in the database is stored in UTC format, so you'd need to convert to different time zones, and build a very complex WHERE clause with ANDs and ORs. Or, alternatively, send lots of narrow queries and combine the results.\r\n\r\nInstead, you can express this in a simple string:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- NYSE trading hours on workdays for January\r\nSELECT * FROM trades\r\nWHERE ts IN '2024-01-[01..31]T09:30@America/New_York#workday;6h29m';\r\n```\r\n\r\nReading this from left to right, we will the days in `2024-01` in the range of `01..31` (all of them), with the interval beginning at `09:30` in New York time, only considering working days, and the interval ending after `6h29m` on each day (inclusive, so at 16:00 New York time).\r\n\r\nWe then compile this to an efficient interval scan, with the time filtering pushed down:\r\n\r\n```\r\n intervals: [\r\n    (\"2024-01-01T14:30:00.000000Z\",\"2024-01-01T20:59:59.999999Z\"),     \r\n\r\n    (\"2024-01-02T14:30:00.000000Z\",\"2024-01-02T20:59:59.999999Z\"),\r\n\r\n    (\"2024-01-03T14:30:00.000000Z\",\"2024-01-03T20:59:59.999999Z\"),\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax makes it easier to construct complex intervals, and keep confidence that the execution plan will be optimal.\r\n\r\nPlease see the [TICK docs](https://questdb.com/docs/query/operators/tick/)  for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### arg_min, arg_max, and geomean aggregates\r\n\r\nLet's say you are monitoring trading data, and you track what the max trading price was over an hourly period. You can express that like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT timestamp, symbol, max(price)\r\nFROM trades\r\nWHERE timestamp IN today()\r\nAND symbol IN ('BTC-USDT', 'ETH-USDT')\r\nSAMPLE BY 1h;\r\n```\r\n\r\n| timestamp                   | symbol   | max(price) |\r\n| --------------------------- | -------- | ---------- |\r\n| 2026-01-28T00:00:00.000000Z | ETH-USDT | 3029.32    |\r\n| 2026-01-28T00:00:00.000000Z | BTC-USDT | 89488.3    |\r\n| 2026-01-28T01:00:00.000000Z | BTC-USDT | 89495.0    |\r\n| 2026-01-28T01:00:00.000000Z | ETH-USDT | 3026.58    |\r\n| 2026-01-28T02:00:00.000000Z | BTC-USDT | 89450.0    |\r\n| 2026-01-28T02:00:00.000000Z | ETH-USDT | 3018.31    |\r\n| ... | ... | ... |\r\n\r\nBut now we have a problem - at what time or trade was that the max price?\r\n\r\nUsing `arg_max`, we can extract values from the row where the price was max:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT timestamp, symbol, max(price), arg_max(timestamp, price)\r\nFROM trades\r\nWHERE timestamp IN today()\r\nAND symbol IN ('BTC-USDT', 'ETH-USDT')\r\nSAMPLE BY 1h;\r\n```\r\n\r\n| timestamp                   | symbol   | max(price) | arg_max(timestamp, price)   |\r\n| --------------------------- | -------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |\r\n| 2026-01-28T00:00:00.000000Z | ETH-USDT | 3029.32    | 2026-01-28T00:26:05.512000Z |\r\n| 2026-01-28T00:00:00.000000Z | BTC-USDT | 89488.3    | 2026-01-28T00:59:57.971000Z |\r\n| 2026-01-28T01:00:00.000000Z | BTC-USDT | 89495.0    | 2026-01-28T01:20:45.782000Z |\r\n| 2026-01-28T01:00:00.000000Z | ETH-USDT | 3026.58    | 2026-01-28T01:03:35.940000Z |\r\n| 2026-01-28T02:00:00.000000Z | BTC-USDT | 89450.0    | 2026-01-28T02:05:50.368000Z |\r\n| 2026-01-28T02:00:00.000000Z | ETH-USDT | 3018.31    | 2026-01-28T02:02:04.936999Z |\r\n| ... | ... | ... |\r\n\r\nPretty handy! \r\n\r\n`geomean(D)` calculates the geometric mean for a set of positive numbers; this is a useful average variant, which improves accuracy for data with large outliers, and commonly used for growth rate calculations.\r\n\r\nFor more details, please check out the [aggregate function](https://questdb.com/docs/query/functions/aggregation/#arg_max) documentation.\r\n\r\n### EMA, VWEMA, percent_rank window functions\r\n\r\nWe've introduced new exponential moving average (EMA) window functions. This smooths out your data base on a smoothing and time period.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we've added a volume-weighted variant (VWEMA), which is commonly used for trading data, allowing for smoothing of the function whilst still prioritising higher-volume trades.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of the syntax:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- Standard average\r\navg(value) OVER (window_definition)\r\n\r\n-- Exponential Moving Average (EMA)\r\navg(value, kind, param) OVER (window_definition)\r\n\r\n-- Volume-Weighted Exponential Moving Average (VWEMA)\r\navg(value, kind, param, volume) OVER (window_definition)\r\n```\r\n\r\n`percent_rank` returns the relative rank of a row within a group of values. This is calculated based on the number of rows within the group, and its position.\r\n\r\nFor more information, please see the [window functions](https://questdb.com/docs/query/functions/window-functions/reference/) documentation.\r\n\r\n### Web Console\r\n\r\nWe've added new improvements to the 'QuestDB AI Assistant' feature, improving the speed and responsiveness of the chat. We'll be following up soon with an expansion of supported model providers. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e856a6ef-d17f-4e35-b4af-5fc9988a6719\r\n\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n#### Time-intrinsics upgrades\r\n\r\n\r\n- QuestDB will now optimise time-range queries over tables where the range uses a constant `dateadd` offset. \r\n    - e.g. `WHERE dateadd('m', 15, timestamp) = '2022-03-08T18:30:00Z'` \r\n- QuestDB will optimise time filters that include `OR` clauses:\r\n    - e.g. `WHERE timestamp IN '2018-01-01' OR timestamp IN '2018-01-02' OR timestamp IN '2018-01-03'` \r\n- We've improved how time-range pushdown is handled within nested queries:\r\n    - e.g. `SELECT * FROM (SELECT dateadd('h', -1, timestamp) as ts, price FROM trades) WHERE ts in '2022'`\r\n\r\n#### Parquet and File-handling\r\n\r\n- We have significantly sped-up querying parquet queries by optimising how row-groups are decoded, giving up to a 6x performance boost versus the last release.\r\n- We've optimised how file mappings are handled, removing sporadic query latency increases over extremely concurrent query workloads.\r\n\r\n## Changelist\r\n* feat(sql): volume-weighted exponential moving average (VWEMA) window function by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6651\r\n* feat(sql): add arg_min() and arg_max() aggregate functions by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6652\r\n* feat(sql): implement EMA window function via avg() by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6650\r\n* fix(ilp): prevent writes going to the wrong place after a table rename by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6654\r\n* feat(sql): add bool_and() and bool_or() aggregate functions by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6658\r\n* feat(sql): add bit_and(), bit_or(), and bit_xor() aggregate functions by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6660\r\n* feat(sql): add geomean() aggregate function by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6656\r\n* fix(sql): prevent SIGSEGV in window join by awaiting workers before freeing cache by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6662\r\n* feat(sql): recognize dateadd predicates in time intrinsic filters by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6666\r\n* fix(sql): potential segfault on vectorized GROUP BY query timeout by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6667\r\n* feat(sql): support nested window functions with deduplication optimization by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6643\r\n* feat(sql): add within_box, within_radius, and geo_within_radius_latlon functions by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6664\r\n* feat(sql): recognize OR of timestamp IN predicates as interval intrinsics by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6673\r\n* fix(sql): handle unbalanced quotes in SQL line comments by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6684\r\n* perf(core): avoid contention across concurrent queries on expensive file operation by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6688\r\n* perf(sql): apply scan optimization for `first/last/min/max(timestamp)` as function argument  by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6690\r\n* fix(sql): error on group by with many aggregate functions by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6689\r\n* feat(sql): add length_bytes() function for varchars by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6685\r\n* fix(sql): fix reverse-order argument parsing in multi-arg window function by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6697\r\n* fix(sql): proper error message when timestamp used along another join key in ASOF/LT join by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6698\r\n* fix(sql): fix an issue where the DECLAREd symbols weren't honored when parsing function arguments by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6700\r\n* fix(sql): fix parquet read failure on chained window join by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6676\r\n* fix(sql): resolve 'Invalid column' error in WINDOW JOIN with aliased columns by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6701\r\n* feat(sql): TICK -

    "title": "Release 9.3.1",
    "text": "# Release 9.3.1 (9.3.1)\n\n# QuestDB 9.3.1\r\n\r\nQuestDB 9.3.1 follows the major 9.3.0 release, focusing on stability, correctness, and performance refinements based on early feedback and production usage.\r\n\r\nThis release delivers targeted fixes across joins, views, and checkpointing, alongside continued performance improvements on hot SQL execution paths.\r\n\r\n## Improvements\r\n\r\n### Arithmetic expressions in window functions\r\n\r\nWindow functions now support arithmetic expressions directly, allowing analytical queries to compute derived values inline without requiring subqueries or post-processing:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  symbol,\r\n  price,\r\n  price - lag(price) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol ORDER BY ts) AS delta\r\nFROM trades\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis simplifies common patterns such as calculating deltas, ratios, and scaled values within window definitions.\r\n\r\n### Extended `tables()` metadata\r\n\r\nThe `tables()` system view now exposes two additional columns:\r\n\r\n- `table_min_timestamp`\r\n- `table_max_timestamp`\r\n\r\nThese columns provide quick visibility into the temporal bounds of each table, useful for diagnostics, retention checks, and operational tooling.\r\n\r\n### `ksum()` window function\r\n\r\nThe `ksum()` function now works as a window function, using the Kahan summation algorithm for improved floating-point precision. This complements the existing `ksum()` aggregate function by enabling its use in window contexts:\r\n```sql\r\n-- Cumulative sum with reduced floating-point error\r\nSELECT ksum(price) OVER (ORDER BY ts ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) FROM trades;\r\n\r\n-- Sliding window\r\nSELECT ksum(price) OVER (ORDER BY ts ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) FROM trades;\r\n\r\n-- Partitioned\r\nSELECT ksum(price) OVER (PARTITION BY symbol) FROM trades;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll standard window frame types are supported: `ROWS`, `RANGE`, partitioned, unbounded, and sliding windows.\r\n\r\n## Performance\r\n\r\n### Streaming Parquet export\r\n\r\nParquet exports via the HTTP `/exp` endpoint now stream directly from page frames, eliminating intermediate temporary tables. This reduces memory overhead and improves export throughput for large result sets.\r\n\r\n### Reduced garbage on parallel query hot paths\r\n\r\nParallel query execution has been optimized to reduce garbage generation on hot paths. This lowers GC pressure and improves throughput and tail latency under sustained analytical workloads.\r\n\r\n### Avoid repeated expression execution\r\n\r\nQueries where columns reference other columns now avoid redundant expression evaluation. This improves performance for wide projections and queries with multiple derived columns.\r\n\r\n## Bug fixes\r\n\r\n### SQL and query execution\r\n\r\n- Fixed an error when using `WINDOW JOIN` (introduced in 9.3.0) with `ORDER BY ts DESC`.\r\n- Fixed a crash in `ASOF JOIN` queries when the `ON` clause mixes `SYMBOL` and non-symbol columns.\r\n- Fixed transient \"file does not exist\" errors that could surface during query execution.\r\n\r\n### Views and materialized views\r\n\r\n- Fixed an issue where views (introduced in 9.3.0) could become suspended after being altered.\r\n- Fixed a rare bug that could write invalid data into a materialized view under specific conditions.\r\n\r\n### Core, storage, and checkpoints\r\n\r\n- Fixed checkpoint restore logic by removing phantom table directories left on disk.\r\n- Fixed a rare issue where process memory was not fully released on Linux when jemalloc is enabled.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who reported issues, shared production feedback, and contributed fixes and improvements.

    "text": "# Release 9.3.0 (9.3.0)\n\n# QuestDB 9.3.0\r\n\r\nQuestDB 9.3.0 is now available, bringing a new wave of query expressiveness and usability improvements across the engine and the Web Console. This release introduces window joins for precise time-based analytics, database views for cleaner query composition, AI-assisted workflows in the web console, and the new PIVOT keyword for effortless wide-schema aggregations.\r\n\r\nFor any questions or feedback, please join us on [Slack](https://slack.questdb.com/) or on [Discourse](https://community.questdb.com/).\r\n\r\nSee also our _prettier_ [release notes](https://questdb.com/release-notes/) page.\r\n\r\n## New Features\r\n\r\n### Views\r\n\r\nViews are virtual tables defined by a `SELECT` statement. They do not persist data on disk. Instead, the underlying query is executed as a subquery each time the view is referenced.\r\n\r\nComplex calculations and logic can be captured in a view, and shared across database users.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE VIEW latest_trades AS\r\nSELECT\r\n  symbol,\r\n  side,\r\n  last(price) AS price,\r\n  last(timestamp) AS ts\r\nFROM trades\r\nGROUP BY symbol, side;\r\n```\r\n\r\nViews can be queried just like tables, while always reflecting the latest data from their source tables.\r\n\r\n#### Parameterisation\r\n\r\nViews can be parameterised:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE VIEW filtered_trades AS (\r\n  DECLARE \r\n      OVERRIDABLE @min_price := 100\r\n  SELECT ts, symbol, price \r\n  FROM trades \r\n  WHERE price >= @min_price\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis view contains the `@min_price` parameter, with a default value. Additionally, its tagged as `OVERRIDABLE`. This means that the user reading from the View can alter this parameter:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nDECLARE \r\n    @min_price := 500 \r\nSELECT * FROM filtered_trades\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithin a View, `DECLARE` variables are constant unless explicitly declared to be `OVERRIDABLE`. This allows you to create Views with pre-set filters, limiting which rows the end user has access to:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE VIEW last_24h_trades AS (\r\n   DECLARE \r\n       @min_ts := dateadd('d', -1, now())\r\n   SELECT * FROM trades \r\n   WHERE timestamp >= @min_ts\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe end user cannot widen this lower time bounds parameter.\r\n\r\nPlease see [the docs](https://questdb.com/docs/concepts/views/) for more information. \r\n\r\n### PIVOT\r\n\r\nThis release introduces the new `PIVOT` keyword.\r\n\r\n`PIVOT` is a specialised form of `GROUP BY` that transforms rows into columns, helping you move from a narrow schema to a wide one in a single query.\r\n\r\nA traditional aggregation might look like this (try on demo!):\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT side, symbol, last(price) AS price\r\nFROM trades_latest_1d\r\nWHERE symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')\r\nORDER BY side, symbol;\r\n```\r\n\r\nResulting in a narrow result set:\r\n\r\n| side | symbol  | price   |\r\n| ---- | ------- | ------- |\r\n| buy  | BTC-USD | 91128.4 |\r\n| buy  | ETH-USD | 3111.53 |\r\n| sell | BTC-USD | 91128.3 |\r\n| sell | ETH-USD | 3111.48 |\r\n\r\nWith `PIVOT`, the same aggregate can be computed and output with a column generated for each pivot key combination. In this case, the pivoting key is `symbol`, and the aggregate value is `last(price)`.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ntrades_latest_1d\r\nPIVOT (\r\n  last(price)\r\n  FOR symbol IN ('BTC-USD', 'ETH-USD')\r\n  GROUP BY side\r\n) ORDER BY side;\r\n```\r\n\r\n| side | BTC-USD | ETH-USD |\r\n| ---- | ------- | ------- |\r\n| buy  | 91484.5 | 3129.76 |\r\n| sell | 91484.4 | 3129.47 |\r\n\r\nThis makes it much easier to work with dashboarding and data analysis tools, where column-per-symbol is a natural analysis and charting format. \r\n\r\n#### Dynamic PIVOT keys\r\n\r\n`PIVOT` can generate columns based on keys generated by a query. For example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\ntrades_latest_1d\r\nPIVOT (\r\n  last(price)\r\n  FOR symbol IN (SELECT DISTINCT symbol FROM trades_latest_1d)\r\n  GROUP BY side\r\n) ORDER BY side;\r\n```\r\n\r\n| side | SOL-BTC   | ETH-USDC | BTC-USD | DOT-USD | DOGE-USDT | ADA-USD | ... |\r\n| ---- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ------- | --------- | ------- | --- |\r\n| buy  | 0.0015273 | 4235.24  | 91576.3 | 2.132   | 0.22609   | 0.4029  | ... |\r\n| sell | 0.0015257 | 4235.95  | 91572.9 | 2.131   | 0.22603   | 0.4025  | ... |\r\n\r\nPlease see [the docs](https://questdb.com/docs/query/sql/pivot/) for more information. \r\n\r\n### Window joins (beta)\r\n\r\nQuestDB now supports `WINDOW JOIN`, a new join syntax designed specifically for time-based analytics.\r\n\r\n`WINDOW JOIN` allows each row from a primary table to be joined with a time window of rows from another table, with aggregations computed over the matching rows. This makes short-horizon analytics—such as correlating trades with nearby market prices—both expressive and efficient.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT\r\n  t.*,\r\n  avg(p.bid) AS avg_bid,\r\n  avg(p.ask) AS avg_ask\r\nFROM trades t\r\nWINDOW JOIN prices p\r\n  ON p.sym = t.sym\r\n  RANGE BETWEEN 1 second PRECEDING\r\n        AND 1 second FOLLOWING\r\n  INCLUDE PREVAILING;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, each row from `trades` is joined with all rows from `prices` that share the same symbol and fall within the [-1s, +1s] interval (inclusive). Aggregations are then calculated over the joined rows.\r\n\r\nThis syntax avoids complex subqueries and makes time-windowed joins explicit, readable, and performant, with SIMD acceleration employed for the most common aggregate functions.\r\n\r\nPlease see [the docs](https://questdb.com/docs/query/sql/window-join/) for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### AI-assisted workflows in the Web Console (beta)\r\n\r\nThe QuestDB Web Console now includes LLM-powered assistance, available on an opt-in basis using your own API key.\r\n\r\nOnce enabled, the console can:\r\n\r\n- Auto-describe table schemas and column semantics\r\n- Annotate sample rows with plain-language context\r\n- Walk through query execution plans, highlighting joins, filters, and index usage\r\n\r\nThis makes it easier to understand both what a query does and how it executes—directly where you write SQL.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1920\" height=\"1140\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0866d2d6-aab3-4069-8128-52e53cd7c563\" />\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n- JIT-compiled filters have undergone an optimisation pass, and will now execute up to **2x faster**.\r\n- Queries with `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` can now be executed in parallel, with execution times up to **10x faster**.\r\n- `SELECT min(timestamp), max(timestamp) FROM table` will now execute in O(1) time (**instantly**), when `timestamp` is the designated timestamp.\r\n- Querying external parquet files with `read_parquet('data.parquet')` will now use projection pushdown, signficantly reducing disk and memory usage, and speeding up execution times by as much as **100x**.\r\n- Parquet exporting has been sped up by reducing the number of intermediate commits applied during the copy process.\r\n\r\n## Changelist\r\n* fix(sql): segfault when using `touch()` on a table with a new empty column by @nwoolmer in

    "text": "# Release 9.2.3 (9.2.3)\n\nQuestDB 9.2.3 is a patch release bringing the usual swathe of fixes, performance enhancements, and a few new features. You'll see higher QPS, faster `GROUP BY` queries, and better performance for high-contention materialized views.\r\n\r\nThere will be one more release before Christmas, bringing the new `WINDOW JOIN` syntax. Stay tuned!\r\n\r\nFor any questions or feedback, please join us on [Slack](https://slack.questdb.com/) or on [Discourse](https://community.questdb.com/).\r\n\r\nSee also our _prettier_ [release notes](https://questdb.com/release-notes/) page.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n- **Materialized Views**\r\n    - **Faster updates under high contention**: views which update frequently (multiple times per second) will now use significantly less resources and have reduced refresh latency.\r\n    - **Faster historical refreshes**: views with very small `SAMPLE BY` units will now refresh much more quickly, especially for historical or full refreshes.\r\n- **TTL**\r\n    - **Additional safety checks**:  TTL will now use `min(maxTimestamp, wallClockTime)` as the predicate for dropping old partitions, rather than just `maxTimestamp`. This avoids accidental partition drops when erroneous timestamps are written to the table.\r\n- **SQL**\r\n    - **Faster (de)allocations**: Memory deallocations have been sped up significantly, with `jemalloc` now enabled by default on Linux builds. This particularly helps for reducing query tail latencies.\r\n    - **Faster query compilation**: Query parsing performance has been improved by around ~4x. This reduces latency for lightweight and fast-to-execute queries, and maximises concurrent QPS when prepared statements are not used.\r\n    - **Faster single-key `GROUP BY`**: `GROUP BY` queries that group by a single key will now execute ~2-3x faster.\r\n        - e.g. `SELECT symbol, count() as count FROM trades GROUP BY symbol ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 10;` \r\n    - **Faster non-keyed averages**: Keyless `GROUP BY` queries will now execute ~1.3x faster.\r\n        - e.g. `SELECT AVG(price) FROM trades;` \r\n    - **Decimal fills**: `SAMPLE BY` with `FILL` now properly supports the new `DECIMAL` type.\r\n\r\n## Changelist\r\n* fix(core): fix missing partition dir on table reader open when writing identical data with dedup by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6479\r\n* fix(sql): crash when using parallel ORDER BY with LIMIT and JIT filter by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6482\r\n* fix(ui): remove line ending declarations from web console assembly descriptor by @emrberk in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6490\r\n* feat(core): hints for handling histogram out of bounds error for approx_percentile()/approx_median() by @peter007-cmd in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6446\r\n* perf(sql): use unordered maps only in single-column case by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6481\r\n* fix(sql): fix parquet export bug when SQL contains `now()` function by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6499\r\n* fix(sql): fix empty result set from limit queries by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6504\r\n* fix(sql): fix potential crash when `ORDER BY` symbol column added via `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6505\r\n* fix(sql): improve refresh step estimation for sparse data with small `sample by` interval by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6517\r\n* chore(utils): update async-profiler to 4.2.1 by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6473\r\n* fix(core): data corruption after range replace on column top partition by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6519\r\n* fix(http): correct HTTP content length for JSON responses by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6520\r\n* perf(core): optimize mat view writing by skipping transactions that are fully replaced by future commits or full refresh (2) by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6495\r\n* fix(core): fix bad connection state after TLS session initialization failure by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6529\r\n* fix(sql): fix potential unexpected exception when parquet file schema changed in `read_parquet()`  by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6513\r\n* feat(core): use wall clock for TTL to prevent accidental data loss by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6531\r\n* fix(sql): support for decimal types in group by fill and selected cursor by @RaphDal in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6532\r\n* fix(sql): not to ignore outer limit if a subquery has a filter and another limit by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6533\r\n* perf(sql): reduce query latency from memory deallocation overhead on Linux x86_64 by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6477\r\n* fix(sql):  fix symbol column nullValue flag when adding column to non-empty table by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6507\r\n* perf(sql): improve latency of parsing SQL expressions by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6538\r\n* perf(sql): speed up avg() functions in non-keyed GROUP BY queries by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6542\r\n* fix(core): UPDATE to work with bind variables for TIMESTAMP columns by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6510\r\n* fix(sql): allow aggregate functions inside CASE expressions by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6550\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @peter007-cmd made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6446\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/compare/9.2.2...9.2.3",

Here is an example:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE orders (\r\n      ts TIMESTAMP,\r\n      price DOUBLE\r\n  ) timestamp(ts) PARTITION BY DAY;\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO orders\r\n  SELECT\r\n      generate_series as timestamp,\r\n      rnd_double() * 10.0 + 5.0\r\n      FROM generate_series('2025-01-02', '2025-01-02T00:10', '200u');\r\n\r\nWITH\r\n  offsets AS (\r\n    SELECT sec_offs, 10_000_000 * sec_offs usec_offs \r\n    FROM (SELECT x-61 AS sec_offs FROM long_sequence(121))\r\n  )\r\n  SELECT /*+ markout_horizon(orders offsets) */ sum(price) FROM (SELECT * FROM (\r\n    SELECT price, ts + usec_offs AS timestamp\r\n    FROM orders CROSS JOIN offsets\r\n    ORDER BY ts + usec_offs\r\n  ) TIMESTAMP(timestamp));\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn an `r7a.4xlarge` instance:\r\n\r\n|    Metric                      | Without Hint | With Hint |\r\n|----------------------|--------------|-----------|\r\n| Query time           | 135s         | 17s       |\r\n| Additional memory usage | 8.4 GB    | 0.1 GB    |\r\n\r\nThis is part of a series of features focused around optimising post-trade analysis, and driven directly by user feedback, so keep it coming!\r\n\r\n**Performance**\r\n\r\n- Reduction in GC overhead for executing high-cardinality `GROUP BY`/`SAMPLE BY` queries.\r\n- `count_distinct()` has been sped up, up to `2x` based on standard benchmarks.\r\n- Reduced memory usage for reads and writes over HTTP.\r\n- General SQL query latency reduction by optimising `munmap` usage:\r\n    - This is opt-in, and can be enabled by setting `cairo.file.async.unmap.enabled=true` \r\n\r\n**SQL**\r\n\r\n- New `files(s)` and `glob(s)` for scanning and filtering the server's filesystem.\r\n- New `glob(Ss)` function, an alternative to `LIKE` and `~` that uses glob-style syntax.\r\n- New `first_not_null(array)` and `last_not_null(array)` group by functions.\r\n- New API endpoint for validating SQL queries: `/api/v1/sql/validate`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelist\r\n* fix(ilp): backwards incompatible way of writing null arrays by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6396\r\n* perf(http): garbage-free HTTP header parser by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6397\r\n* fix(ilp): remove multi-url blacklisting code by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6393\r\n* perf(sql): remove litter generated by ordered map rehashing by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6399\r\n* fix(pgwire): support UUID bind variables in JIT filters by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6413\r\n* fix(sql): order-by ignored in sub-queries of aggregation by @RaphDal in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6414\r\n* feat(sql): add first_not_null(array)  by @mcadariu in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6344\r\n* fix(sql): cannot compile query with aggregate function containing unary minus by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6404\r\n* perf(sql): improve SQL latency by moving munmap() to a background job by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6386\r\n* fix(sql): query with limit x, y (x > 0 & y > 0) return correct `size()` by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6409\r\n* feat(sql): add last_not_null(array) by @mcadariu in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6368\r\n* fix(sql): fix add index issue for symbol columns in matviews by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6424\r\n* feat(sql): implement `files(s)`, `glob(s)` and `glob(Ss)` functions by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6391\r\n* perf(sql): optimized Markout Horizon CROSS JOIN by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6283\r\n* perf(sql): speed up keyed parallel GROUP BY in case of high cardinality count_distinct() by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6432\r\n* fix(sql): fix sample by with only one fill option by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6437\r\n* fix(core): fix rare suspended WAL table when ALTER and RENAME are executed concurrently by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6440\r\n* fix(sql): fix a bug that made some ASOF JOIN queries fail with an internal error by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6433\r\n* feat(http): REST API for SQL validation by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6383\r\n* fix(sql): fix a bug where a query hint in main SELECT would end up in CTEs as well by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6441\r\n* fix(sql): limited subqueries within a union not skipping rows correctly by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6395\r\n* fix(sql): export parquet support empty table/partition by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6420\r\n* feat(sql): period sample by interval syntax for materialized views by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6428\r\n* fix(http): negative `questdb_json_queries_connections` gauge  by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6444\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @liuguoqingfz made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6242\r\n* @Mittalkabir made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6260\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/compare/9.2.0...9.2.1",

    "text": "# Release 9.2.0 (9.2.0)\n\n# ✨ QuestDB 9.2: Native DECIMAL Type\r\n\r\nQuestDB 9.2.0 brings the long-awaited `DECIMAL` type, a bespoke decimal type, declared using `DECIMAL(precision, scale)`. Under the hood, the database automatically selects an optimal storage size, from `DECIMAL8` (1 byte) up to `DECIMAL256` (32 bytes). All of our usual arithmetical operations are supported out-of-the-box, making it easy to adopt and avoid precision loss.\r\n\r\nWith this new `DECIMAL` type, and our recently released support for nanosecond timestamps (`TIMESTAMP_NS`), QuestDB has never been a better fit for [capital markets](https://questdb.com/market-data/)!\r\n\r\nThis release also brings upgrades to our already-fast `ASOF JOIN` queries, with a new `Dense` algorithm optimised for distant row matching. This marks our fourth `ASOF JOIN` algorithm, helping you to ensure your temporal join queries stay performant, regardless of your underlying data distribution.\r\n\r\nFor any questions or feedback, please join us on [Slack](https://slack.questdb.com/) or on [Discourse](https://community.questdb.com/).\r\n\r\nSee also our _prettier_ [release notes](https://questdb.com/release-notes/) page.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n### `DECIMAL(precision, scale)`\r\n\r\n**High-precision arithmetic**\r\n\r\n`DECIMAL` allows for arithmetic without precision loss, and only a slightly performance cost (2x for `DECIMAL64` vs `DOUBLE`); aoperations which would silently lose precision with `DOUBLE` will instead warn the user, preserving data integrity.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- With DOUBLE:\r\nSELECT 0.1 + 0.2; -- returns: 0.30000000000000004 \r\n\r\n-- With DECIMAL:\r\nSELECT 0.1m + 0.2m;  -- returns: 0.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Configurable scale**\r\n\r\nConfigure precision and scale directly, without worrying about the underlying data type, with support for up to `76` digits!\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE transactions (\r\n    id LONG,\r\n    amount DECIMAL(14, 2),      -- Up to 999,999,999,999.99\r\n    tax_rate DECIMAL(5, 4),      -- Up to 9.9999 (e.g., 0.0875 for 8.75%)\r\n    quantity DECIMAL(10, 3),     -- Up to 9,999,999.999\r\n    timestamp TIMESTAMP\r\n) timestamp(timestamp);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**API compatibility**\r\n\r\n`DECIMAL` is supported over PG Wire, ILP and HTTP APIs, with parquet support coming very soon.\r\n\r\n**Use cases**\r\n\r\n- Preserving integrity of data in ledgers, simplifying regulatory compliance\r\n- Easy storage for cryptocurrency data, ordinarily requiring at least 18 digits of precision.\r\n- No need to work around integer-scaling or integer signedness issues.\r\n\r\nSee the [decimal concepts](https://questdb.com/docs/concept/decimal/) documentation for more information.\r\n\r\n### Dense ASOF JOIN\r\n\r\nQuestDB 9.2.0 introduces a new 'dense' `ASOF JOIN` algorithm, optimised for datasets where the matching rows are likely to be far apart. This complements the existing `ASOF JOIN` algorithms to ensure that your queries can achieve the best performance regardless of your data distribution. \r\n\r\nThe choice of which algorithm to use is important, and explained in detail in the [optimizer hints documentation](https://questdb.com/docs/concept/sql-optimizer-hints/#temporal-join-hints).\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the algorithms:\r\n\r\n- `Fast`; optimised for closely matching rows, using a binary-search and backwards scans.\r\n- `Memoized`; the same as `Fast`, but more tolerant of occassional distant matches.\r\n- `Light`; optimised when the RHS table has a highly selective filter, using forward-only scan on RHS table.\r\n- `Dense`; optimised for distant matches, using a binary-search, bidirectional scans and memoized results.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to iterate on this feature in conjunction with the upcoming performance optimisations for markout analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelist\r\n* feat(sql): enable symbol capacity auto-scaling by default by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6352\r\n* fix(core): prevent rare exception from async jobs when table is dropped by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6361\r\n* fix(core): prevent async jobs from getting SIGBUS error under extreme system load by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6357\r\n* fix(core): fix critical storage corruption on deduplicate write resulting to same data by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6359\r\n* perf(sql): optimize ASOF JOIN for dense interleaving of left-hand and right-hand rows by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6362\r\n* feat(core): support for Decimal by @RaphDal in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6068\r\n* fix(core): fix occasional errors in result set size calculation by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6351\r\n* chore(core): correct Decimal type indices in `ColumnTypeTag` enum by @RaphDal in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6382\r\n* feat(core): add a GC-free `CharSequence` -> `int` hash map for `WalWriter` symbols by @RaphDal in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6371\r\n* fix(sql): always free parquet buffers when executing queries in parallel by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6372\r\n* feat(core): move release to use Graal CE JDK by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6390\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/compare/9.1.1...9.2.0",

    "text": "# Release 9.1.1 (9.1.1)\n\n# QuestDB 9.1.1\r\n\r\nQuestDB 9.1.1 focuses on data interoperability, nanosecond precision, and analytical performance.\r\nThis release introduces Parquet export, a faster ASOF JOIN for sparse symbol data, and several engine optimizations improving both query throughput and stability.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n### **Data Interoperability**\r\n- **Parquet export**: `COPY TO` now supports exporting query results directly to Parquet format for seamless integration with **data-lake and analytics tools** such as Spark, Snowflake, and Athena (#6008).\r\n- **Optimized Parquet import**: `read_parquet()` recognizes **timestamp-sorted data**, significantly accelerating ingest for large, time-ordered datasets (#6079).\r\n\r\n### **Precision**\r\n- **Nanosecond precision ingestion**: The Java ILP client now supports **nanosecond timestamps**, aligning with QuestDB’s highest-precision timekeeping (#6220).\r\n- **Synthetic data generation**: New `rnd_symbol_zipfn()` function produces **high-cardinality symbol distributions** following a Zipf / Power Law — ideal for testing realistic workloads (#6227).\r\n\r\n### **Performance**\r\n- **ASOF JOIN optimization**: Major speedup for joins on **low-frequency symbols** via a memory-efficient lookup strategy that reuses symbol search results (#6208, #6333).\r\n- **Query engine improvements**:\r\n  - Parallel `count_distinct()` now uses a **lazy merge strategy**, reducing memory usage (#6268).\r\n  - Expanded **fast path** optimization for ordered and limited single-column queries (#6272).\r\n  - **Parallel SAMPLE BY** execution for queries combining timestamps and aggregates (#6275).\r\n  - Disabled column pre-touch in parallel filters, improving cache efficiency (#6280).\r\n\r\n## 🧱 Parquet Export\r\n\r\nQuestDB now supports exporting tables or queries to **Parquet format** using the `COPY` command — enabling direct data exchange with data lakes and analytics pipelines.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- export an entire table to parquet, with same partitioning as original\r\nCOPY 'table_name' TO 'folder_name' WITH FORMAT PARQUET;\r\n\r\n-- export a subquery to parquet with new partitioning\r\nCOPY (SELECT * FROM trades WHERE timestamp IN today()) TO 'folder_name' WITH FORMAT PARQUET PARTITION_BY MONTH;\r\n```\r\nUsers can also parquet data ad-hoc using `/exp?fmt=parquet` (and omitting `COPY`).\r\n\r\n**Benefits**\r\n- Efficient columnar compression and encoding\r\n- Open, widely supported format\r\n- Perfect for interoperability with modern data ecosystems\r\n\r\n## 🧮 New SQL Functions\r\n\r\n- **`rnd_symbol_zipfn()`** – generates high-cardinality symbols following a Power Law distribution (#6227).\r\n- **`last(array)`** – returns the last element from an array expression (#6291).\r\n- **Nanosecond support** – added new `nanos` functions and improved `CAST` behavior for date types (#6247).\r\n\r\n## ⚙️ SQL & Query Engine\r\n\r\n- Recognize timestamp-sorted data in `read_parquet()` for faster imports (#6079).\r\n- Fixed invalid column errors in `GROUP BY` on joined tables (#6275, #6332).\r\n- Improved `GROUP BY` and `SAMPLE BY` to avoid duplicate group keys (#6275).\r\n- Fixed incorrect results from `SAMPLE BY` with mixed timestamp / aggregate expressions (#6254).\r\n- Corrected handling of negative offsets in `SAMPLE BY` (#6306).\r\n- Fixed JIT compilation for `WHERE sym1 = sym2` filters (#6321).\r\n- Fixed overflow in materialized view refresh interval and step calculations (#6233, #6258).\r\n- Interval constants can now be applied as **time intrinsics** (#6263).\r\n- Prevented critical-level logs on group-by query cancellation (#6235).\r\n- Fixed `NullPointerException` issues in window and optimizer code paths (#6264, #6265).\r\n\r\n## 📥 Ingestion (ILP)\r\n\r\n- Java ILP client now supports **nanosecond precision** timestamps (#6220).\r\n- Fixed flaky `LineHttpSenderLoggingTest` stability issue (#6315).\r\n\r\n## 🧩 Core & Operations\r\n\r\n### Resource & Reliability\r\n- Added **resource pool tracing** to help detect memory leaks during development and testing (#6234).\r\n- Fixed potential **connection leaks on Windows** (#6243).\r\n- Fixed index error after column addition and truncation of non-partitioned tables (#6319).\r\n- Fixed `NullPointerException` in `ColumnPurgeJob` (#6274).\r\n- Improved reliability under high connection load (#6334).\r\n- Added debug logging to WAL purge operations (#6336).\r\n\r\n### HTTP Server\r\n- Relaxed cookie parser for **legacy HTTP 1.0 and ANSI C timestamp formats** while maintaining RFC 2616 compliance (#6290).\r\n\r\n### Web Console\r\n- Updated to **Web Console v1.1.4** (#6309).\r\n- Fixed issue preventing configuration override on upgrade (#6240).\r\n\r\n## ⚡ Performance & Stability\r\n\r\n- Disabled column pre-touch in parallel filters for better cache utilization (#6280).\r\n- Added new `GroupByArraySink` for optimized aggregation (#6237).\r\n- Improved parallel group-by performance and stability (#6303).\r\n- Optimized `count_distinct()` memory usage via lazy merge (#6268).\r\n- Faster single-column ordered queries with expanded fast-path coverage (#6272).\r\n\r\n## 🛠 Build & Infrastructure\r\n\r\n- Bumped `gosu` in Dockerfile to address CVE-2023-28642 (#6252).\r\n- Added license field to Rust crates (#6284).\r\n- CI pinned to macOS 14 for consistent builds (#6314).\r\n- Extract site config files even if site extraction is disabled (#6281).\r\n- Moved CI coverage jobs

    "text": "# Release 9.1.0 (9.1.0)\n\nQuestDB 9.1.0 is now available. It is a feature-rich release bringing nanosecond timestamp data type, performance and stability improvements.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n- **Nanosecond timestamps**: New `TIMESTAMP_NS` type adds nanosecond precision to time-series data (#5685).  \r\n- **Continuous profiling**: Integrated [async-profiler](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler) lets you capture CPU and memory flame graphs continuously or on demand (#6150).  \r\n- **JOIN improvements**: Support for all JOIN types including RIGHT OUTER and FULL OUTER, plus dramatically faster ASOF JOINs on indexed columns (#6158, #6076).  \r\n- **New SQL functions**: Added timestamp and long window functions, plus visibility into symbol table size via `SHOW COLUMNS` (#6130, #6128).  \r\n- **Performance wins**:  \r\n  - **Symbol map auto-scaling**: Eliminates ingestion bottlenecks from fixed symbol capacity. Now millions of distinct values ingest in seconds instead of hours.  \r\n  - Faster `IN (...)` queries on large lists (breaking change 💥).  \r\n\r\n##  **Nanosecond timestamp support** 🛡️ \r\n\r\nQuestDB now supports **nanosecond precision** with a new data type: `TIMESTAMP_NS`.\r\n\r\n- The existing `TIMESTAMP` type remains **microsecond** precision and is unchanged.  \r\n- `TIMESTAMP_NS` can be used in all contexts where `TIMESTAMP` is valid (columns, functions, joins, ordering, etc.).  \r\n- **Migration**: No changes are required for existing tables. They will continue to use `TIMESTAMP` (microsecond).  \r\n- **Rollback compatibility**:  \r\n  - If you do not create tables with `TIMESTAMP_NS`, you can safely roll back to QuestDB 9.0.3 or earlier.  \r\n  - If you do create tables with `TIMESTAMP_NS`, older versions will not recognize this type. Such tables must be dropped before rolling back.  \r\n- **Drivers and client libraries**: `TIMESTAMP_NS` is supported by existing QuestDB drivers (JDBC, Go, Python, etc.), provided you are on a **recent release** of the driver. No protocol upgrade or client code changes are required.  \r\n\r\n## Symbol map auto-scaling (opt-in)\r\n\r\nSymbol column map capacity now **scales automatically** with the number of distinct values, removing one of the biggest friction points in high-ingestion workloads.\r\n\r\n- **Before:** symbol map capacity was fixed at table creation.  \r\n  - If undersized, ingestion performance could degrade by up to **1000×**, often making ingestion practically impossible.  \r\n  - For example, on default settings the system would bog down at ~1,000,000 unique symbols, taking several hours to ingest that data (unless the user had pre-sized the symbol map correctly).  \r\n\r\n- **Now:** with auto-scaling enabled, symbol capacity grows dynamically:  \r\n  - ~2,000,000 distinct values ingested in **2.5 seconds** (vs hours).  \r\n  - ~40,000,000 distinct values ingested in **2.5 minutes** (vs never finishing before).  \r\n\r\n- **Backward compatibility:**  \r\n  - Auto-scaling is **opt-in** to preserve compatibility.  \r\n  - Enabling it stores metadata in a new structure that **older versions cannot read**.  \r\n  - If rollback is required, data does **not** need to be dropped, but some **manual file renaming** steps are necessary. Users can contact QuestDB support for guidance. \r\n\r\n- **Opt-in instructions:**\r\n\r\nEnable via configuration property, system's restart is not required:\r\n```\r\ncairo.auto.scale.symbol.capacity=true\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Continuous profiling support (opt-in)\r\n\r\nQuestDB now ships with the [Async Profiler](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler) integrated out-of-the-box. This dramatically reduces friction when diagnosing performance issues such as **high CPU usage** or **queries that appear slow**.\r\n\r\n- **Ease of use:** the profiler is bundled, no manual installation required.  \r\n- **Opt-in:** profiling has **no impact** on performance unless enabled.  \r\n- **Performance impact:**  \r\n  - 0% overhead when not in use.  \r\n  - ~10% overhead when the profiler is actively connected.  \r\n- **Modes of use:**  \r\n  1. **Start with profiling enabled** – less common, but can help during development or long-running load tests.  \r\n  2. **Attach to a running instance** – the most useful mode, allows “catching the system in the act” when issues are intermittent or difficult to reproduce.  \r\n\r\n#### Examples\r\n\r\nStart a 30s CPU profiling session and generate an interactive HTML flamegraph:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nquestdb.sh profile -- -e cpu -d 30 -f /tmp/cpu.html\r\n```\r\n<img width=\"900\" height=\"400\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e5be19ea-d482-4b22-bf84-f2ada5a96663\" />\r\n\r\n##  SQL & Query Engine\r\n\r\n- Nanosecond timestamp support for ultra-high resolution time-series workloads (#5685).\r\n- New window functions for timestamp and long data types (#6130).\r\n- Symbol table size visibility added to SHOW COLUMNS (#6128).\r\n- Optimized IN (...) comparisons on long lists — breaking change 💥 (#6109).\r\n- Enhanced JOIN execution with multiple improvements (#6076).\r\n- Faster ASOF JOIN on indexed symbol columns (#6158).\r\n- Vectorized avg(short) and improved sum() functions memory usage (#6166).\r\n- GROUP BY queries now rewrite trivial expressions over the same column for better performance (#6043).\r\n- Improved null-handling in INSERT INTO SELECT queries with implicit casting (#5586).\r\n- Consistent behavior of EXPLAIN command (#6200).\r\n- Fixed NPE in DISTINCT queries with dependent columns (#6080).\r\n- Fixed compilation error for symbol column to symbol cast in GROUP BY queries (#6072).\r\n- Fixed nanosecond precision issues in ASOF JOIN TOLERANCE and CSV imports (#6183).\r\n- Prevented multiple DECLARE statements in single query block (#6161).\r\n- Fixed rare assertion error after metadata changes (#6195).\r\n\r\n##  Ingestion (ILP)\r\n\r\n- Improved handling of symbol ingestion with double column conversion (#6143).\r\n- Retry logic fixed when fetching server protocol version (#6099).\r\n- Support for configuring multiple possible database endpoints (#6074).\r\n- Improved connection handling — now avoids closing connections on protocol errors (#6190).\r\n\r\n## Core & Operations\r\n\r\n### Continuous profiling support\r\n\r\nQuestDB now integrates the [Async Profiler](https://github.com/async-profiler/async-profiler) for low-overhead performance diagnostics.\r\n\r\n- **Modes**:  \r\n  - Continuous profiling at startup (`questdb.sh start -p`)  \r\n  - On-demand attach to running instances for CPU or allocation traces  \r\n- **Outputs**:  \r\n  - Interactive HTML flame graphs  \r\n  - JFR (Java Flight Recorder) output ([#6150](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6150))  \r\n\r\n### Threading and resource usage\r\n\r\n- Materialized view refreshes now run on a dedicated thread pool ([#6111](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6111))  \r\n\r\n### Reliability fixes\r\n\r\n- Fixed rare index reader memory error on partition drop ([#6087](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6087))  \r\n- Fixed suspended table showing wrong `writerTxn` ([#6090](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6090))  \r\n- Fixed table read timeout after non-WAL drop/re-create ([#6095](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6095))  \r\n- Fixed rare suspension on index drop ([#6147](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6147))  \r\n- Fixed misleading “table locked” error appearing before write failures ([#6152](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6152))  \r\n- Fixed failure handling on column renames ([#5752](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5752))  \r\n- Fixed spurious “cannot mmap” errors ([#6104](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6104))  \r\n- Fixed incorrect error handling that could leave table reader in an inconsistent state ([#6108](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6108))  \r\n- Fixed memory tags used in `Path` ([#6124](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6124))  \r\n- Fixed assertion exception in writer triggered by OS errors ([#6204](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6204))  \r\n\r\n## Breaking change 💥\r\n\r\n`IN` list queries now use **hash-based lookups** instead of binary search, delivering significant performance gains for large lists.\r\n\r\n- **Performance**: Faster execution for queries with thousands of `IN` values.  \r\n- **Configuration**: JIT compilation is skipped for lists larger than `cairo.sql.jit.max.in.list.size.threshold` (default: 10,000).  \r\n- **Behaviour**: Results remain equivalent, but execution order and memory usage may differ in edge cases.\r\n\r\nMigration guidance:\r\n\r\n- No SQL syntax changes are required\r\n- If you notice regressions for small lists or need JIT for large lists, adjust `cairo.sql.jit.max.in.list.size.threshold`.  \r\n- Benchmark your workloads to tune the threshold for optimal results. \r\n- Expect faster performance for large `IN` lists out of the box. \r\n\r\nThis change matters most for queries with very large `IN` lists (thousands of values), often seen in data filtering, batch imports, or security/ACL checks. These workloads will now execute much faster by default.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* build: 9.0.3 by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6086\r\n* fix(core): fix rare index reader

It accelerates common query patterns, reduces resource usage, and adds quality-of-life features across SQL, the PostgreSQL wire protocol (PGWire), ingestion, and operations.\r\n\r\n### Highlights\r\n\r\n**ORDER BY … LIMIT, now parallelised**. Sort-and-limit queries execute much faster on large datasets — _up to 10× in internal tests._\r\n\r\n**Dedicated thread pools.** Reads, writes, and network operations run on separate pools for better isolation and predictable latency under load.\r\n\r\n**Array improvements.** New functions `array_stddev()`, `array_min()`, and `array_max()`; support for negative indexing (e.g., `array[-1]` for the last element); and improved Parquet compatibility for array columns.\r\n\r\n**Lower resource footprint.** File descriptors and memory maps are cached more aggressively. CSV import is faster (especially for `VARCHAR`), and materialized views do less I/O with small `SAMPLE BY` intervals.\r\n\r\n### SQL & Ingestion Protocol\r\n\r\n**`TRUNCATE IF EXISTS`** avoids errors when truncating a table that may not be present.\r\n\r\n**PostgreSQL wire protocol (PGWire)**: improved handling of bind variables for more predictable prepared-statement behaviour.\r\n\r\n**Ingestion clients for ILP**: helpers `reshape()` and `clear()` make array reuse simpler and reduce allocations.\r\n\r\n### Performance\r\n\r\n**Parallel ORDER BY + LIMIT** delivers markedly lower end-to-end latency for top‑N queries.\r\n\r\n**Thread-pool separation** prevents read workloads from contending with writers or network services during spikes.\r\n\r\n**Faster CSV import** for `VARCHAR`-heavy payloads via improved parsing and reuse.\r\n\r\n### Reliability & Operations\r\n\r\n**CPU spike resolved** in specific concurrent workloads.\r\n\r\n**Window functions**: intermittent failures addressed.\r\n\r\n**Index lookups**: corrected edge cases that could yield wrong results.\r\n\r\n**WAL lag metrics** now persist across restarts for continuous observability.\r\n\r\n**Native libraries** are no longer placed under `/tmp`, aligning better with hardened security policies.\r\n\r\n**Contributors**\r\n\r\nThanks to first‑time contributors:\r\n\r\n@TaniyaKatigar, @aleksandarskrbic, @akashadsare, @gauravjain0377\r\n\r\nThank you to everyone who reported issues and shared production insights — your feedback powers QuestDB.\r\n\r\n### Changelist\r\n\r\n* perf(http): speed up varchar parsing in CSV import by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5985\r\n* feat(docs): Added beginner-friendly video tutorial on setting up QuestDB – by Taniya Katigar by @TaniyaKatigar in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6000\r\n* fix(sql): fix spurious 'undeclared variable' error by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6003\r\n* fix(sql): fix possible constant increase in CPU usage from SQL text parser by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6004\r\n* fix(sql): reduce write amplification for materialized views with small SAMPLE BY interval by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5995\r\n* feat(sql): support negative index in array access by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5997\r\n* chore(core): allow TableToken lookups by CharSequence by @amunra in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/6011\r\n* feat(sql): array_stddev(), array_min(), array_max() functions by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5992\r\n* fix(build): load native libs from distribution lib dir, not /tmp by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5932\r\n* perf(core): introduce three shared thread pools -

    "text": "# Release 9.0.0 (9.0.0)\n\nQuestDB 9.0 is now available. This release includes major improvements across performance, features, and reliability.\r\n\r\nWe've added support for N-dimensional arrays, improved materialized views with calendar awareness, and made joins more efficient. Data deduplication is faster and more accurate. The Web Console has a simpler, cleaner interface.\r\n\r\nThese changes make 9.0 our most complete open source release yet — solid for both new and existing deployments.\r\n\r\n> Read our [release blog](https://questdb.com/blog/questdb-9-release/)\r\n\r\n### N-dimensional Arrays\r\n\r\nQuestDB 9.0 debuts true N-dimensional Arrays. These are true shaped-and-strided, NumPy-like arrays — common array operations (e.g. slicing, transposing) are handled with zero copying. Instead, the underlying buffer is shared between different operators, whether the arrays are stored on-disk or in-memory. The data is contiguous and stored as a true tensor rather than nested lists.\r\n\r\nEnjoy zero-copy slicing, transposing, cumulative ops, and aggregates—ideal for market data order-book depth or ML weight snapshots, with more data types on the way.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2944\" height=\"1466\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5fc34a5a-a65c-428f-b1c3-8fa4a2db884e\" />\r\n\r\nOur first public beta supports `DOUBLE[]` of any shape. Several array operations are included, and we will be rapidly releasing more. \r\nRun spread, liquidity, and imbalance analytics in a single SQL line — no ETL, no UDFs.\r\n\r\n### Binary line protocol\r\n\r\nTo push those arrays at wire speed, InfluxDB Line Protocol (\"ILP\") now speaks binary `DOUBLE[]` / `DOUBLE`.\r\n- Higher throughput, smaller payloads than text.\r\n- Back-compat: old clients keep working; new clients unlock dedup, schema evolution, fail-over hooks.\r\n\r\nHere's an example that demonstrates sending `double[]` to QuestDB from a Pandas DataFrame:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport pandas as pd\r\nfrom questdb.ingress import Sender\r\n\r\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\r\n    'symbol': pd.Categorical(['ETH-USD', 'BTC-USD']),\r\n    'side': pd.Categorical(['sell', 'sell']),\r\n    'price': [2615.54, 39269.98],\r\n    'amount': [0.00044, 0.001],\r\n    'ord_book_bids': [\r\n        np.array([2615.54, 2618.63]),\r\n        np.array([39269.98, 39270.00])\r\n    ],\r\n    'timestamp': pd.to_datetime(['2021-01-01', '2021-01-02'])})\r\n\r\nconf = f'http::addr=localhost:9000;'\r\nwith Sender.from_conf(conf) as sender:\r\n    sender.dataframe(df, table_name='trades', at='timestamp')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new binary protocol paves the way for smarter clients with native hooks into QuestDB essentials—deduplication, schema evolution, and replication failover.\r\n\r\n### Materialized Views\r\n\r\nMaterialized Views receive significant upgrades - efficient writes with the new `replace commit` mechanism, support for self-UNION queries, the ability to delay or defer a refresh, and three new view refresh modes:\r\n\r\n- `TIMER` refreshes (now stabilised), allowing you to refresh the view after a regular time interval.\r\n- `MANUAL` refreshes, which are entirely user-controlled.\r\n- `PERIOD` refreshes, with more explanation below.\r\n\r\n`PERIOD` refresh is the most featureful mode to date, bringing time-zone aware, calendar-scheduled refreshes, only including complete buckets of data. This has great potential, especially for users with globally distributed use cases.\r\n\r\nOne view can summarise NYSE trades right after the New York bell, while another waits for Tokyo’s close, all with the same clean syntax:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_latest_1d\r\nREFRESH PERIOD (LENGTH 1d TIME ZONE 'America/New_York' DELAY 2h) AS\r\nSELECT \r\n    timestamp, \r\n    symbol, \r\n    side, \r\n    last(price) AS price, \r\n    last(amount) AS amount, \r\n    last(timestamp) AS latest\r\nFROM trades\r\nSAMPLE BY 1d;\r\n```\r\n\r\n`MANUAL` refreshes allow you, the user, to integrate matieralized views directly with your scheduling platform. You can take control of the refresh, triggering it exactly when you need it. But better yet, each refresh will still be incremental, meaning you don't have to trade efficiency for better control.\r\n\r\nTo recap, see the full [materialized views documentation](https://questdb.com/docs/guides/mat-views/).\r\n\r\n### Data deduplication\r\n\r\nOne of the important performance enhancements brought in 9.0.0 is increased data deduplication efficiency.\r\n\r\nUsers leverage our simple and easy-to-use `DEDUP` keyword, to idempotently retry, resend, and update data. This is a relatively efficient affair, and if no dedup is required, it carries (from original tests) around an 8% overhead. With our already sky-high ingestion performance, this slowdown was barely noticeable.\r\n\r\nHowever, when reloading bulk data where (almost) everything was being deduplicated, this would run a little slower. Here are some rough figures from a TSBS bench:\r\n\r\n| Version / Action |  Initial load | Full reload  |\r\n|------------------|---------------|--------------|\r\n|            8.3.3 | ~1m rows/s    | ~520k rows/s |\r\n|            9.0.0 | ~1.2m rows/s  | ~1.7m rows/s |\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n  <summary>Benchmark details</summary>\r\n\r\n    - Type: cpu-only\r\n    - Scale: 4000\r\n    - Workers: 4\r\n    - Total rows: ~100m\r\n    - Hardware: 2021 M1 Macbook Pro 16 GB\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nWe'll follow up soon with a fresh round of our standard benchmarks.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, with 9.0.0, reloading the data is even faster than writing it in the first place, if most of it must be deduplicated. This is especially apparent when running on slower disks or block storage!\r\n\r\nThis is critical for many workloads - data arrives late, out-of-order, partially complete, and this makes it trivial to reload data en-masse and clean it up.\r\n\r\nWe'll be following this soon with some other great improvements. For now, `DEDUP` only supports `last-writer-wins` behaviour (`REPLACE`). But we will soon be adding `first-writer-wins` (`SKIP`) and merging of partial rows (`MERGE-SKIP` and `MERGE-REPLACE). With these alternate modes, we will cover many more use cases and in some cases, remove the need for external stream processing tools.\r\n\r\n### Web Console \r\n\r\nOur web console sports a fresh coat of paint, bringing long-sought-after features.\r\n\r\nFirstly, each query is marked by its own run arrow and selection, making it easy to see at a glance where your semicolon-delineated boundaries lie. Also, you can now obtain query plans by right-clicking on the run arrows, helping you better understand and debug troublesome queries—no more typing out the `EXPLAIN` keyword, only to delete it straight afterwards!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1786\" height=\"912\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c22b4bf5-ca59-4c1b-9d70-6b184c360c7f\" />\r\n\r\nThe console can now execute multiple queries in one go—drag-select or hit Run All—with results captured in a new Query Log. Ideal for migration scripts, and you can choose to halt the batch on the first error.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"3024\" height=\"1546\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e21381c-50d3-430b-b35d-65f85160390a\" />\r\n\r\nWe've refreshed our [Web Console documentation](https://questdb.com/docs/web-console/), and invite you to take a tour of our new features.\r\n\r\n### ASOF JOIN with TOLERANCE\r\n\r\n`ASOF JOIN` is a quick and easy way to merge time-series together. We recently added an [alternative binary-search algorithm](https://questdb.com/docs/concept/sql-optimizer-hints/#avoid_asof_binary_search-and-avoid_lt_binary_search) to better handle matching illiquid symbols.\r\n\r\nIn a follow-up, we've also added a [new `TOLERANCE` parameter](https://questdb.com/docs/reference/sql/asof-join/#tolerance-clause), which allows to bound your matches to a sensible time. This is handy if you have quantities that 'expire' after a certain time-period.\r\n\r\nHere's an example query, in which we match the last 6 top-of-book bid prices against the offer prices, with a 1 second tolerance.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nDECLARE\r\n  @level := insertion_point(bids[2], bid_volume),\r\n  @price := bids[1][@level]\r\nSELECT\r\n  md.timestamp market_time,\r\n  @level level,\r\n  @price market_price,\r\n  cp.timestamp core_time,\r\n  cp.bid_price core_price\r\nFROM  (\r\n  core_price\r\n  WHERE timestamp IN today()\r\n  AND symbol = 'GBPUSD'\r\n  LIMIT -6\r\n) cp\r\n-- Match the bid to its nearest price within one second.\r\nASOF JOIN market_data md\r\nON symbol TOLERANCE 1s;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis query is one of many that feature on our new FX order-book dashboard. Here's a sneak preview:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"2545\" height=\"1824\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dda118b-6564-4ef7-a40d-37cd5dd77fbd\" />\r\n\r\n### Roundup\r\n\r\n9.0 is a big milestone, yet just another waypoint on our roadmap. Huge thanks to everyone who opened issues, pinged us on Slack, or shared production insights—your feedback powers QuestDB.\r\n\r\nWe'll end it here so you can get busy upgrading to QuestDB 9.0.0, but don't forget to check out all the other performance upgrades, new functions, and (of course) bug fixes that come with this milestone release. \r\n\r\nFor any questions or feedback, please join us on [Slack](https://slack.questdb.com/) or on [Discourse](https://community.questdb.com/).\r\n\r\nSee also our _prettier_ [release notes](https://questdb.com/release-notes/) page.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes 💥\r\n\r\n- **Materialized Views** \r\n    -  `REFRESH LIMIT` and `REFRESH EVERY` settings have been reset, due to a change in storage format.\r\n        - `REFRESH EVERY` (`TIMER` views)  must be dropped and recreated. \r\n        - `REFRESH LIMIT` can be re-added with an alter\r\n            - `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW trades_latest_1d SET REFRESH LIMIT 1 WEEK;` \r\n    - `TIMER` refresh syntax has been inverted from what is was originally:\r\n        - Instead of `REFRESH START <timestamp> EVERY <interval>`\r\n        - It is now `REFRESH EVERY <interval> START <timestamp>`\r\n    - `REFRESH INCREMENTAL` has been changed to `REFRESH IMMEDIATE` (but older syntax is still accepted).\r\n- **Column Aliasing** \r\n     - The aliasing rules for expressions without explicit aliases have now been changed.\r\n     - Previously:\r\n         - `SELECT spread(bid, ask)` would give an output column of `spread`.\r\n         - Repeated functions would have a number appended\r\n         - Plain expressions such as `5 + 2` would be named `column`.\r\n     - Going forward:\r\n         - The expression itself will be used as the column name:\r\n             - `floor(avg(price*amount))` now outputs `floor(avg(price * amount))` as the column name.\r\n             - Repeated expressions (which are unlikely), will have numbers appended.\r\n             - The max length of the output column alias is configurable: `cairo.sql.column.alias.generated.max.size`\r\n             - This change **can be reverted** (for now) using `cairo.sql.column.alias.expression.enabled=false`.\r\n- **PG Wire**\r\n    - Users who opted out of the new faster and less buggy PG Wire implementation have been **opted back in**.\r\n    - The new PG Wire driver was initially released in September 2024, and we consider it robust and stable.\r\n    - If users need to opt back out, they can do so by changing `pg.legacy.mode=!true`, but should adopt the new modern `PG Wire` server as soon as possible, as we will remove this option soon.  \r\n- **JOIN**\r\n    - `TOLERANCE` is now a keyword, so if you were using it in implicit aliasing, it will need to be quoted i.e. \"TOLERANCE\".  \r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n- **Multidimensional arrays**\r\n    - New `double[]` type, which is a shaped-and-strided n-dimensional array.\r\n    - Addition of new binary protocol to ILP clients to efficiently send `double` and `double[]` types. \r\n        - Literals: `SELECT ARRAY[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`\r\n        - 2D: `SELECT ARRAY[[a], [b]] FROM tango`\r\n        - Indexing: `SELECT arr[1][2] FROM samba` or `SELECT arr[1,2] FROM samba`\r\n        - Slicing: `SELECT arr[2:], arr[1:100] FROM samba`\r\n        - ND Slicing: `SELECT arr[2:3, 3:4], arr[1:, 2] FROM samba`\r\n        - Math: `SELECT a * b FROM samba`\r\n        - Functions: `SELECT matmul(arr, transpose(arr)) FROM samba`\r\n- **Materialized Views**\r\n    - View updates are much faster due to new timestamp range-replace commits. \r\n    - `TIMER` views have been stabilised, and now offer a new `TIME ZONE` clause, to make your refresh timezone-aware.\r\n    - `MANUAL` refresh mode has been added, for fully manual (but incremental) view refreshing.\r\n    - `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` now accepts a `DEFERRED` clause, to delay or prevent the initial eager refresh upon view creation.\r\n    - `REFRESH LIMIT` is now respected during a full view refresh.\r\n    - `PERIOD` refresh mode has been added, which supports calendar-scheduled, timezone-aware refreshes that include only complete SAMPLE BY buckets.\r\n    - Self-`UNION` queries are now supported.\r\n- **SQL**\r\n    - **JOIN**\r\n        - `CROSS JOIN` queries have been sped up significantly, after identifying an issue with cursor resets.\r\n        - `ASOF` and `LT` joins now support a `TOLERANCE` clause, which specifies a maximum bound for the timestamp matching\r\n            -  `SELECT ... FROM table1 ASOF JOIN table2 ON <key> TOLERANCE interval_literal [WHERE ...]`\r\n        - Time-based joins on `SYMBOL` columns have been sped up through early-exits when it is known that no `SYMBOL` match can occur.\r\n    - **SELECT**\r\n        - Columns within in a `SELECT` statement are now self-referenceable and memoised.\r\n            - This is convenient and also improves the efficiency of functions such as `json_extract`.\r\n            - For example, `SELECT x + 10 y, y - 5 FROM test`.\r\n    - A new `generate_series()` function has been added.\r\n        - This is a pseudo-table allowing for timestamp, double and long range generation.\r\n        - `SELECT * FROM generate_series('2025-06-13T09:00:00', '2025-06-13T10:00:00', '1m');`\r\n        - Negative steps can be used, to produce values in descending order.\r\n- **DEDUP**\r\n    - Data deduplication performance has been dramatically improved when inserting completely identical data en-masse.\r\n\r\n## Changelist\r\n\r\n* fix(sql): potential memory leak in plain INSERTs by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5706\r\n* fix(sql): unreliable out-of-memory error propagation in parallel SQL by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5711\r\n* fix(sql): invalidate dependent materialized views on base table rename by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5693\r\n* feat(core): N-dimensional array support by @amunra in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5243\r\n* fix(sql): failing OOM recovery due to too strict RSS limit checks by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5717\r\n* feat(core): use timestamp range replace updates to update mat views by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5679\r\n* fix(core): fix issue when running in directory path that includes characters unsupported in URLs by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5736\r\n* fix(ilp): buffer management with varchar columns by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5738\r\n* fix(core): fix degradation into 1 by 1 wal transaction application when queue is big by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5725\r\n* feat(sql): allow self-UNION queries in materialized views by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5730\r\n* fix(sql): fix unexpected columns being added to the SQL projection from `order by` expression by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5748\r\n* fix(sql): fix an issue where a query declared under WITH, using TIMESTAMP(ts), would result in parsing error by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5746\r\n* fix(sql): correct error position for syntax errors in CREATE AS SELECT by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5756\r\n* fix(pgwire): resolve intermittent NullPointerException during INSERTs by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5788\r\n* feat(sql): add generate_series() functions by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5761\r\n* fix(sql): make `sample by week` align to natural calendar. by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5785\r\n* feat(sql): breaking change 💥 -

    "text": "# Release 8.3.2 (8.3.2)\n\n8.3.2 is a stability release, bringing a number bugfixes and improvements. There have been improvements to materialized views, checkpoints, `zfs` support, and instance metrics, and of course, our built-in web console!\r\n\r\nMaterialized Views can now be configured to refresh on a timed schedule, instead of immediately whenever new data is written. You can also modify the TTL and refresh limit post-creation, giving you more flexibility to optimise current and new views.\r\n\r\nTaking checkpoints will now consume much less disk space, and we've also added some new metrics to help you to monitor your overall database's health, and be alerted to writing delays or suspended tables.\r\n\r\nThe web console now allows you to set the instance name and colour. This is especially useful for production users, who have multiple deployments and flick between them. This should make it easier keep track of things, and label the instance with a useful name for its users.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4d610de-717c-4b3c-8fde-17d94ef548d7\" width=\"607\" height=\"290\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis release will shortly be followed by the first `beta` release of the new `ARRAY` type. This is a multi-dimensional array (think NumPy), which will initially support `DOUBLE` values. This will be accompanied by the first upgardes for the ILP clients, to move from the text protocol to a bespoke binary protocol. This means arrays can be sent to the database efficiently, without expansion into lots of text, and is the first step towards supporting all of QuestDB's rich features through the database clients.\r\n\r\nFor any questions or feedback, please join us on [Slack](https://slack.questdb.com/) or on [Discourse](https://community.questdb.com/).\r\n\r\nSee also our _prettier_ [release notes](https://questdb.com/release-notes/) page.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes 💥 \r\n\r\n- The `greatest` and `least` functions will now only return a `null` if **all** of the inputs are null, instead of **any**. This aligns the behaviour with MSSQL.\r\n\r\n- The `WITHIN` function now defaults to a different implementation, which runs `WITHIN` before `LATEST BY`. \r\n    - If you were using the old implementation, which ran `LATEST BY` first, you can re-enable it using `query.within.latest.by.optimisation.enabled=true`.  This variant was only used for `WHERE` + `LATEST BY` + indexed symbols, and at no other time.\r\n    - Or alternatively, use the new implementation and a subquery to force the `LATEST BY` to run first.\r\n\r\n### Highlights\r\n\r\n#### UI\r\n\r\n- The web console now allows you to set an instance's name and colour! This is handy when switching between different deployments and instances, to make sure you run your queries on the correct console. \r\n- The query log UI element has been upgraded, fixing a few snags, and now supports horizontal scrolling for long rows.\r\n- (Enterprise) SSO users will not have to log back in every time they log out; instead, an existing SSO session can be resumed, or you can switch to a different account.\r\n\r\n#### Prometheus Metrics \r\n\r\nNew metrics have been added to help monitor the performance of tier-1 (WAL) and tier-2 (Table) storage:\r\n\r\n- `suspended_tables`; this is a global counter for how many tables are currently suspended.\r\n- `wal_apply_seq_txn`; this is a global counter for `sequencerTxn`, the txn number corresponding to the latest transaction written to WAL, for a particular table.\r\n- `wal_apply_writer_txn`; this is a global counter for `writerTxn`, the txn number corresponding to the latest transaction visible for read, for a particular table.\r\n- You can subtract the above two numbers and track this over time, to estimate if the database is backing up and falling behind on data visibility.\r\n- You can also track replication lag by comparing metrics between the primary and the replica. More granular information can be obtained by polling `wal_tables()` and `sys.telemetry_wal`;\r\n \r\n#### Materialized Views\r\n\r\n- Materialized Views can now be refreshed on a timer schedule. \r\n    - `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW price_1h REFRESH START '2025-09-12T00:00:00.000000Z' EVERY 1h AS ...`\r\n    - You can also alter existing views to swap to a new scheduled refresh:\r\n    - `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW price_1h SET REFRESH START '2035-09-12T00:00:00.000000Z' EVERY 1d;`\r\n- You can now add a `TTL` post-creation:\r\n    - `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name SET TTL 42 DAYS;`\r\n- You can now add a refresh limit post-creation, which bounds how far back an incremental refresh will go\r\n    - `ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW view_name SET REFRESH LIMIT 12 HOURS;`\r\n- Base table names are no longer case-sensitive.\r\n \r\n#### Checkpointing\r\n\r\n- The storage cost to have an active checkpoint has been dramatically reduced. This means you are less likely to run out of storage if you have out-of-order (O3) writes whilst `CHECKPOINT CREATE` is active.\r\n    - If you encounter any issues, you can roll back to the old version using `cairo.txn.scoreboard.format=1`.\r\n    - This change also fixes `max txn in-flight` errors, which could be caused by a leaked query.\r\n\r\n#### Geospatial\r\n\r\n- We have upgraded the `WITHIN` operator to work for generic `WHERE` clauses, instead of just `LATEST BY` queries. This should make it much easier to filter for data by geohash location.\r\n\r\n### Changelist\r\n\r\n* fix(sql): fix string constant unescaping in JIT by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5649\r\n* fix(core): remove critical log message when processing multiple transactions on dedup table by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5650\r\n* fix(core): fix deadlock in logging when handling disk full FS error by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5634\r\n* feat(core): reduce active checkpoint disk cost  by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5444\r\n* fix(core): fix startup logging to only check existing dirs for supported file system by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5658\r\n* fix(sql): missing tables and materialized views are not critical errors by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5654\r\n* feat(sql): ALTER MATERIALIZED VIEW SET REFRESH LIMIT and SET TTL by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5638\r\n* feat(core): add prometheus monitoring metrics that track WAL apply progress, suspended tables by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5660\r\n* fix(wal): reading and writing all wal-e data via mmap to address ZFS mixed IO issues by @amunra in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5656\r\n* fix(sql): non-deterministic function not rejected when creating materialized view by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5655\r\n* fix(sql): case sensitive base table name when creating materialized view by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5672\r\n* fix(sql): breaking change 💥- `greatest(V)` and `least(V)` now return null only if all args are null by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5669\r\n* fix(sql): NullPointerException when calling vararg functions with no arguments by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5681\r\n* fix(core): adjust query cache scaling to prevent memory exhaustion by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5683\r\n* fix(core): fixed table metadata commands, incorrectly displayed which column is the designated timestamp by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5684\r\n* fix(sql): fixed error reported when trying to add an already existing column with IF NOT EXISTS by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5675\r\n* fix(sql): fix segfault when using within(geohash) with latest on and partition column is empty by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5688\r\n* fix(pgwire): prevent stale results in LATEST ON queries with bind variables by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5687\r\n* feat(sql): REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW RANGE by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5662\r\n* feat(sql): add multi-datatype support for (LEAD/LAG) window functions by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5524\r\n* feat(sql): breaking change 💥  - parallel filtering geohashes using `WITHIN` by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5682\r\n* feat(sql): timer refresh for materialized views by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5695\r\n* feat(web-console): instance naming UI by @emrberk in https://github.com/questdb/ui/pull/427\r\n* fix(web-console): wait for all body to be streamed before calculating network time by @emrberk in https://github.com/questdb/ui/pull/429\r\n* fix(web-console): jit compiled icon shrink problem and notifications height by @emrberk in https://github.com/questdb/ui/pull/428\r\n* feat(ui): make SSO re-authentication optional on logout by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/ui/pull/412\r\n",

    "text": "# Release 8.3.0 (8.3.0)\n\n8.3.0 moves `Materialized Views` into an advanced `beta`. Thanks to all of you have tried the `beta` and helped us iron out the remaining creases!\r\n\r\nThis release also brings significant ingestion performance improvements, particularly for small transactions and for batched PG Wire inserts. Not to mention a variety of bug fixes and safety enhancements to improve overall user experience.\r\n\r\nBut let's not forget about querying data! Check out how your `ASOF JOIN` queries are doing! We have released dramatic performance improvements for `ASOF JOIN`s that include interval scans and/or post-join filters. Benching against larger datasets has shown 100-1000x speedups for some queries.\r\n\r\nFor any questions or feedback, please join us on [Slack](https://slack.questdb.com/) or on [Discourse](https://community.questdb.com/)!\r\n\r\nSee also our _prettier_ [release notes](https://questdb.com/release-notes/) page!\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes 💥\r\n\r\n* `Materialized Views` will now be **enabled by default**. If you do not wish to use them, you can disable them by setting `cairo.mat.view.enabled=false`.\r\n\r\n* Designated timestamp columns can no longer hold values beyond the Year 9999. We found that these values were generally produced by mistaken arithmetic. This prevents undroppable partition issues, and also reduces the chances of a configured `TTL` dropping your data.\r\n\r\n* Some `IPv4` built-in functions were removed. You may need to introduce explicit casts in SQL queries that relied on implicit conversions between `ipv4` and other database types. This removes some ambiguity that was causing issues with queries unrelated to `ipv4`.\r\n\r\n* Converting `char` to numeric values now aligns with PostgreSQL behaviour, whether implicitly or explicitly casted.\r\n\r\n* `SAMPLE BY` will now correctly handle a variety of DST-related timestamp grouping issues. `SAMPLE BY` queries that use DST shifts are more likely to be executeed in parallel, too. These changes mean your result set might look different to before - but should be a consistent, rational output.\r\n\r\n* `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` types, when output to JSON or web console, will now have different precision. Previously, this was limited artificially. Now, it will print as many digits as it can. If you rely on the old output for any integration testing, you may need to upgrade your tests!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* Materialized Views are now in an advanced `BETA`.\r\n    * Views will be correctly invalidated when the base table is dropped.\r\n    * Syntax errors in materialized view definitions should report the correct error position.\r\n    * `PARTITION BY` and parentheses `()` are now optional.\r\n    * Full mat view refreshes should no longer trigger occassional OOM errors.\r\n    * Still to come: a mat view write-performance enhancement, which is also a pre-step to supporting time-range `DELETE`s!\r\n* `ASOF JOIN` queries that include filters over large datasets will now run 100-1000x faster than before!\r\n* `SYMBOL` columns can now have their capacity changed in-place, using `ALTER TABLE table ALTER COLUMN column SYMBOL CAPACITY 4096`!\r\n* Ingestion of small batches has been sped by up to 100x!\r\n* Ingestion via PG Wire batched inserts is faster and more memory efficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Changelist\r\n\r\n* feat(core): speed up WAL small transaction apply 100x by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5347\r\n* fix(core): mat view is not invalidated when base table is dropped by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5486\r\n* fix(core): make partition drop atomic by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5515\r\n* fix(pgwire): fix handling of sparse bind variables by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5514\r\n* fix(core): prevent inserting designated timestamp beyond year 9999, this would create invalid partition name by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5478\r\n* fix(sql): support casting and aliasing timestamp column in materialized view by @eugenels in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5485\r\n* fix(pgwire): possible unhandled error (double-close) in case of `INSERT` failure by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5523\r\n* fix(sql): crash when GROUP BY key includes timestamp by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5527\r\n* perf(sql): speed-up of simple projections by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5529\r\n* feat(core): accept EntraID's cookie expiry timestamp format by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5470\r\n* feat(sql): change column type SQL to support changing symbol column capacity by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5497\r\n* chore(core): merge identical mem.getDirectVarcharA/B by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5542\r\n* fix(ilp): disable Nagle's algorithm in HttpClient (set TCP_NODELAY flag) by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5550\r\n* fix(sql): stuck thread on high cardinality group by query timeout by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5539\r\n* fix(http): unhandled NullPointerException on SQL query error by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5548\r\n* fix(core): fix issue with missing WAL segment directory during replication by @eugenels in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5538\r\n* fix(sql): make the function's argument overload rules consistent with functions' implementation by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5528\r\n* fix(core): fix critical error message in writing data with deduplication and a possible crash on writing same timestamp lines by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5547\r\n* fix(sql): improve error handling for malformed SQL queries by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5572\r\n* fix(sql): breaking change 💥 -

    "title": "Release 8.2.3",
    "text": "# Release 8.2.3 (8.2.3)\n\n8.2.3 is a stability release, fixing tricky edge cases and increasing the performance of some key queries. These fixes cover many different aspects of the database - better handling of bind variables, faster `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`, reduced memory usage, reduced disk storage for indexes, and more. \r\n\r\nMany of these changes are driven by user feedback, so thanks to all of you whom have helped us to improve QuestDB!\r\n\r\nWe've also been hard at work on our roadmap features, and are excited to bring you an initial `BETA` release for Materialized Views! We will be finalising this feature in the next release, and upgrading it to support more of the `SAMPLE BY` syntax.\r\n\r\nAlong with this, we have added a number of quality-of-life features, some performance enhancements for filtering and distinct queries, and compatibility improvements for older Linux distros.\r\n\r\nWe have also made strong progress towards bringing the new `ARRAY` type, so keep an eye out in our upcoming releases. These are N-dimensional arrays and are heavily optimised for numeric operations. As part of the `ARRAY` development, we will be rolling out the first modifications to the `ILP` clients, to introduce parts of a new binary protocol. This will ensure that throughput is maximised especially for sending arrays and numeric data.\r\n\r\nFor any questions or feedback, please join us on [Slack](https://slack.questdb.com/) or on [Discourse](https://community.questdb.com/)!\r\n\r\nSee also our _prettier_ [release notes](https://questdb.com/release-notes/) page!\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes 💥 \r\n\r\n*  `UUID` and `LONG256` types will now be sorted correctly, respecting unsigned ordering. Previously, they would sort incorrectly. This is a breaking change - but the correct one!\r\n\r\n* You now cannot use `SAMPLE BY` and `GROUP BY` in the same query. This wasn't really supported before, as `SAMPLE BY` is already a group by, and this can cause ambiguity in the query. Now this is enforced, so you should use a subquery for the `SAMPLE BY`, and move your `GROUP BY` to an outer query. You should not notice any performance change from this, simply a syntax change.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n\r\n* Materialized views has been released in `BETA`\r\n    * Materialized views are tables driven by a `SAMPLE BY` query, which are incrementally updated for you whenever new data is written to their parent table.\r\n    * These views help you to downsample data automatically, cache the latest values, and filter out subsets of data from your main table.\r\n    * See the [docs](https://questdb.com/docs/concept/mat-views/) to get started and try it out!\r\n* Relaxed GLIBC requirement  (2.28 aarch64 and 2.17 amd64) to allow QuestDB run on older Linux distros\r\n* New `dense_rank()` window function\r\n    * This is like `rank()`, but guarantees that the ranking numbers are sequential - no gaps!\r\n    * See the  [docs](https://questdb.com/docs/reference/function/window/#dense_rank).\r\n* New `approx_median()` function\r\n    * This is a quicky and easy way to calculate a median value for your data set. It is equivalent to `approx_percentile(_, 0.5)`.\r\n    * See the [docs](https://questdb.com/docs/reference/function/aggregation/#approx_median).\r\n* Performance optimisations giving significant speedups (up to 30x) for certain queries\r\n    * `IN` with subqueries (especially with `SYMBOL` type) - `value IN (select column .... )`\r\n    * `SELECT DISTINCT` queries\r\n\r\n## Changelist\r\n\r\n* fix(core): relax minimal required glibc version to 2.17 on amd64 by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5332\r\n* fix(sql): spurious query cancellation on high server load by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5342\r\n* fix(http): memory leak when querying tables with changing metadata by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5353\r\n* fix(core): edge-case memory leak during disk failure fixed by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5349\r\n* fix(http): fix connection leak under memory pressure by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5355\r\n* fix(sql): fix UnsupportedOperationException thrown when sorting an IPv4 column by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5365\r\n* fix(sql): `SHOW CREATE TABLE` provides invalid ddl when table is not partitioned by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5361\r\n* feat(SQL): refactor `rank()` windowFunction and introduce `dense_rank()` windowFunction by @kafka1991 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5334\r\n* fix(core): relax minimal required glibc version to 2.28 on aarch64 by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5340\r\n* fix(core): fix occasional config parsing error when the context path is set per service by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5378\r\n* fix(sql): NullPointerException in invalid sample by query by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5354\r\n* fix(core): fix updates failing with table busy when non-WAL table is created from ILP by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5383\r\n* fix(core): fix column name case sensitivity in alter column SQL by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5395\r\n* fix(pgwire): fix cursor handling for r2dbc-postgresql compatibility by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5396\r\n* fix(pgwire): compatibility with PHP PDO client by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5402\r\n* feat(core): materialized views by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4937\r\n* fix(core): fix startup delay on instances with lots of data by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5399\r\n* fix(sql): prevent stale metadata after table DROP and (re-)CREATE by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5418\r\n* fix(sql): fix issue comparing symbols and timestamps when symbols were not constant by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5419\r\n* fix(sql): breaking change 💥 -

    "title": "Release 8.2.0",
    "text": "# Release 8.2.0 (8.2.0)\n\nInteroperability is key. The systems that'll succeed in the future are those which play well with others. As such, QuestDB is committed to both open formats and full participation in the many open ecosystems used by our growing community. \r\n\r\nTo that goal, our latest release brings with it a major re-construction of our underlying [PostgreSQL Wire Protocol](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/api/postgres/) implementation. With strict, optimized PGWire compliance, QuestDB 8.2.0 connects gracefully to PowerBI, RStudio, Looker, and much more. And of course, a wave of new functions, Enterprise enhancement, performance improvements, fixes, and much more.\r\n\r\nFor those in the US, we wish you a fine and comforting thanksgiving in the week to come.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Changes 💥\r\n\r\n* **Renamed column in `wal_tables()` function**: The column `writerLagTxnCount` in the `wal_tables()` function has been renamed to `bufferedTxnSize`. This change aims to reduce confusion but may require updates to existing scripts or applications using this function.\r\n\r\n## New Features 🐣\r\n\r\n* **Enhanced PGWire server**: The PostgreSQL server component has been rewritten to strictly comply with the PostgreSQL wire protocol. This ensures better compatibility with PostgreSQL clients and tools, enabling support for applications like Microsoft Power BI and R. Naturally, it's also much, much more performant. How much? **Over 1M rows per second and 700,000 queries per second.** 🔥 🚀 🎸 \r\n\r\n* **[QuestDB Enterprise](https://questdb.io/enterprise/) | Microsoft Entra ID compatibility**: QuestDB Enterprise now supports authentication and authorization via Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) for integration with Microsoft's identity services.\r\n\r\n* **[QuestDB Enterprise](https://questdb.io/enterprise/) | Improved PingFederate support**: Enhanced compatibility with PingFederate, improving single sign-on (SSO) capabilities and integration with enterprise identity management systems.\r\n\r\n* **Window function `count()`**: Support for the `count()` window function has been added. You know, for counting.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT time, value, COUNT(*) OVER (ORDER BY time) AS running_total\r\nFROM measurements;\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **Hash functions `md5`, `sha1`, `sha256`**: Introduced standard hash functions for generating cryptographic hashes of input strings or binary data.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT md5('hello world') AS hash_value;\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **Regression function `regr_intercept()`**: Added the `regr_intercept(y, x)` function to compute the intercept of the linear regression line determined by dependent variable `y` and independent variable `x`.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT regr_intercept(sales, time) FROM revenue_data;\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Performance Improvements 🚀\r\n\r\n* **10× Speedup for small transactions over PGWire**: With the improvements to the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol, we're also seeing up to a tenfold increase in performance for small transactions. This is particularly beneficial for applications that issue frequent small inserts or updates. 🔥 🚀 🎸 \r\n\r\n* **Optimized Window functions**: Improved the performance of [window functions](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/function/window/) via faster hash tables and optimized execution paths. Analytical workloads will appreciate it.\r\n\r\n## Improvements 🛠️\r\n\r\n* **Background job latency control**: Introduced configurable latency setting and deep changes to allow background job execution control. The following new configuration options sets the max amount of time between consecutive commits before WAL apply job takes action and begins merge:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncairo.commit.latency=30s\r\n```\r\n\r\n* **More responsive `health` endpoint**: The [Health HTTP endpoint](https://questdb.io/docs/operations/logging-metrics/#minimal-http-server) is now more responsive, even under high CPU load. For better monitoring, and glory.\r\n\r\n* **Enhanced error handling in HTTP**: HTTP returns more detailed error messages directly to clients, for easier debugging and client-side error handling.\r\n\r\n## Bug Fixes 🐛\r\n\r\n* **Smoother schema change via PGWire**: Resolved issues where spurious errors could occur after table schema changes when using the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol.\r\n\r\n* **Memory limitations for `string_agg()`**: Implemented a cap on memory usage for the `string_agg()` function to prevent potential out-of-memory errors when aggregating large amounts of data.\r\n\r\n* **Corrected Error Messages in table_storage()**: Fixed incorrect error messages when selecting non-existing columns in the table_storage() function.\r\n\r\n* **Fixed disappearing tables after restart**: Addressed a rare issue where tables could disappear after a restart if created with naming collisions. Heh.\r\n\r\n * **Cross-JOIN query circuit breaker**: Ensured that cross join queries are properly cancelled when the circuit breaker is invoked, preventing runaway queries.\r\n\r\n## Full PR List\r\n\r\n### Enterprise\r\n\r\n_Learn more about [QuestDB Enterprise](https://questdb.io/enterprise/)_\r\n\r\nIncludes all of OSS, plus:\r\n\r\n- feat(core): support for decoding groups from ID token\r\n- feat(core): replace admin-only checks with permissions\r\n- fix(core): fix for not being able to login with other users if built-in admin is disabled\r\n- feat(core): config switch to disable ILP over TCP authentication\r\n\r\n### OSS\r\n\r\n* fix(pgwire): fix a spurios errors after table schema change by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5099\r\n* fix(sql): cap `string_agg()` memory use to the \"strFunctionMaxBufferLength\" value by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5106\r\n* feat(http): make healthcheck endpoint responsive on high CPU load by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5108\r\n* fix(sql): fix incorrect error message out of `table_storage` function when selecting non-existing column by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5109\r\n* fix(sql): BREAKING :boom: -

    "text": "# Release 8.1.4 (8.1.4)\n\nIt's spooky season. :jack_o_lantern:\r\n\r\nWhat scares us the most? Poor performance. :scream:\r\n\r\nAnd just behind that, bugs and unintuitive UIs. _Aaaahhhh!!_ \r\n\r\nThis release brings light to all of the aforementioned fears, as we continue with our seasonal theme of balance.\r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes 💥\r\n**SQL keyword quoting enforcement**: SQL keywords used as column names now require double-quoting (e.g., \"distinct\", \"order\", \"group\"). While this was previously required, it's now enforced more strictly. This change supports PostgreSQL-compatible syntax and may break existing queries using unquoted keywords.\r\n\r\n### New features 🐣\r\n\r\n#### Slick Web Console polish\r\n\r\nLast patch, we introduced tabs to the Web Console experience. With tabs, navigating and work flows are easier and cleaner.\r\n\r\nThe polish continues in `8.1.4` and includes many small, tidy incremental improvements such as:\r\n\r\n* More prominent error highlighting\r\n* Prettier formatting when errors are generated by larger queries \r\n* Revamped the look and feel of the table list panel — gone is the pop-up menu\r\n* Once executed via shortcut, such as `F9` or `CTL` + `Enter`, hitting the same shortcut will no longer cancel running SQL\r\n* Indicates `Running..`. when a query is running (... so you'd better go catch it!)\r\n* While `Running..`. the \"play\" button is replaced with \"stop\" button\r\n* Removed `=` as word delimiter, so that expressions like `==` can be highlighted as errors\r\n\r\nAnd more! Download, upgrade or [checkout our live demo](https://demo.questdb.io) to see them.\r\n\r\n#### Regression function `regr_slope()`\r\n\r\nWe've introduced the `regr_slope(y, x)` SQL function, which calculates the slope of the linear regression line determined by the dependent variable `y` and independent variable `x`. One might use such a function in statistical analysis, trend identification, and predictive modelling:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT regr_slope(sales, time) FROM revenue_data;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis query computes the slope of sales over time. Great for trend spotting.\r\n\r\n#### Support for COUNT(DISTINCT col) and STRING_AGG(DISTINCT col)\r\n\r\nThe `DISTINCT` keyword is now available within aggregate functions to operate on unique values.\r\n\r\nCounting unique values:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT count(DISTINCT user_id) FROM events;\r\n```\r\n\r\nAggregating unique strings:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT string_agg(DISTINCT city, ', ') FROM customers;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis simplifies queries where you need to work with distinct entries. We all appreciate more concise and expressive SQL.\r\n\r\n### Performance improvements 🚀\r\n\r\n* Suped up many statistical functions with parallelized execution. Functions like `var_samp()`, `var_pop()`, `stddev_samp()`, `stddev_pop()`, `covar_samp()`, `covar_pop()`, and `corr()` are now up to 10× faster. \r\n\r\n* Reduced memory usage during paralleled aggregate queries\r\n\r\n### General improvements and fixes 🔧 \r\n\r\n* Addressed a disk space leak issue when upserting with deduplication\r\n\r\n* Resolved phantom errors in `SELECT` queries caused by concurrent partition squashing\r\n\r\n* Fixed inconsistencies in the interaction between the Web Console and the static metadata cache\r\n\r\n* Fixed issues causing unexpected timeouts and error messages in parallel query execution\r\n\r\n* Resolved an infinite loop issue that could occur on errors in parallel filter and `GROUP BY` queries - as fun as it was...\r\n\r\n* Addressed a potential transaction leak in table reader/writer initialization on ZFS.\r\n\r\n* Fixed a rare failure to restore from a checkpoint, triggered by an indexed column being created while a checkpoint is in progress.\r\n\r\n* Unified macOS runtime requirements to macOS 13 for build consistency.\r\n\r\n* Fixed checkpoint backward compatibility with snapshot semantics.\r\n\r\n* Fixed a memory leak with pipelined `UPDATE`s in the PostgreSQL Wire Protocol.\r\n\r\n## Pull requests\r\n\r\n* fix(build): Unify MacOS runtime requirements to MacOS 13 by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5035\r\n* perf(sql): reduce memory footprint of parallel aggregate functions by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5046\r\n* fix(sql): fix unexpected timeouts, error messages in parallel query execution by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5039\r\n* fix(core): fix disk space leak on upserting with dedup by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5048\r\n* feat(http): signal empty query as a notice, not an error by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5031\r\n* fix(sql): infinite loop on error in parallel filter and group by queries by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5055\r\n* feat(sql):  breaking change 💥 - support for count(distinct col) and string_agg(distinct col) by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5045\r\n* fix(core): fix phantom select query errors caused by concurrent partition squashing by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5058\r\n* fix(sql): resolve inconsistencies in interaction between web console and static metadata cache by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5043\r\n* feat(sql): add `regr_slope()` SQL function by @vss96 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5021\r\n* fix(http): improved error handling for unsupported column types by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5068\r\n* fix(pgwire): memory leak with pipelined UPDATEs by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5083\r\n* perf(sql): parallelise sample and population variance  by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5072\r\n* perf(sql): parallelise sample and population standard deviation by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5075\r\n* perf(sql): parallelise sample and population covariance by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5074\r\n* fix(core): potential transaction leak in table reader/writer initialization on ZFS by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5086\r\n* fix(core): fix rare failure to restore from checkpoint, triggered by indexed column being created while checkpoint in progress by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5090\r\n* perf(sql): parallelise correlation by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5079\r\n* fix(core): fix checkpoint backward compatibility with snapshot semantics by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5091\r\n* fix(core): fix rare crash on read binary and other var length column types by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5093\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/compare/8.1.2...8.1.4",

It works for us, as this release restores the balance within QuestDB's production reliability. Chasing maximum performance and cutting-edge features is our favourite game. But every now and then, it's essential to double-back and smooth out the edges so that the overall experience presents consistent excellence. And, well, we'll keep improving performance too. \r\n\r\nDownload, upgrade, and prepare for the seasonal feasts. 🎃 \r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes 💥\r\n\r\n- **Logging level adjustments**: Some log messages previously logged at the `INFO` level have been changed to `DEBUG`. This reduction in log verbosity may impact monitoring systems relying on these messages. Adjust logging configurations as necessary. \r\n\r\n### New features 🐣\r\n\r\n- **Web Console UI tabs**: The [QuestDB Web Console](https://questdb.io/docs/web-console/) features tabs for better query management. Tabs are archived upon closing and can be brought back from the history section as needed. \r\n\r\n- **ILP client row cancellation**: The ILP client now supports cancelling the current row during data ingestion. This allows for greater control when writing data and helps prevent incomplete or erroneous data from being committed. \r\n\r\n- **New financial function `spread_bps`**: Computes the spread in basis points between two numerical values. \r\n\r\n- **`greatest` and `least` functions**: Determine the maximum or minimum value from a list of expressions. These functions simplify comparisons across multiple columns or expressions.\r\n\r\n- **Interval functions for date filters**: Implemented new interval functions `today()`, `tomorrow()`, and `yesterday()` that return intervals representing the entire day. These functions make it easier to filter queries based on whole-day periods without manually specifying time ranges. \r\n\r\n- **New aggregate function `string_distinct_agg`**: Aggregates unique string values into a single, concatenated string with a specified delimiter. This is useful for creating summaries of distinct values in a dataset. \r\n\r\n- **ILP traffic to Prometheus**: Introduced metrics to monitor ILP (Influx Line Protocol) traffic volumes over both TCP and HTTP. These metrics help in tracking data ingestion rates and diagnosing network-related issues. \r\n\r\n- **RedHat OpenShift Compatible Docker Image**: Beginning with this release, QuestDB Docker images with a `-rhel` suffix are now compatible with RedHat's OpenShift container orchestration platform.\r\n\r\n### New integrations\r\n\r\n- [**Bento by Warpstream Labs**](https://warpstreamlabs.github.io/bento/docs/components/outputs/questdb/): In the words of Bento they provide: _Fancy stream processing made operationally mundane_. Indeed, and now even fancier with a fresh QuestDB component.\r\n\r\n- [**Redpanda Connect**](https://github.com/redpanda-data/connect/releases/tag/v4.37.0): Formerly Benthos. Comes with a QuestDB output component that can be used as a sink for your stream processing data. [Read our docs](https://questdb.io/docs/third-party-tools/redpanda-connect/) for more information.\r\n\r\n### Performance improvements 🚀\r\n\r\n- **Static metadata cache**: Implemented a static metadata cache to improve performance by reducing the overhead associated with frequent metadata access. This enhancement speeds up query compilation and execution. \r\n\r\n- **Optimized partition reloads**: Reduced unnecessary reloads of `TableReader` partitions, which enhances query performance, especially in environments with high data ingestion rates and frequent queries. \r\n\r\n- **Improved parallel `GROUP BY` execution**: Optimized parallel `GROUP BY` operations by eliminating redundant bytecode generation. This results in faster execution times for complex aggregation queries.\r\n\r\n- **Faster Web Console queries**: You'll notice improved performance during the highligh and execution of queries with SQL comments in the editor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Improvements 🛠️\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced log compatibility**: Added a configuration option to control verbose log levels, improving compatibility with log readers and monitoring tools that require specific log formats or verbosity levels. \r\n\r\n- **Detailed ILP error messages**: Enhanced the server logs to include specific error messages indicating the exact line that caused a receive buffer overflow during ILP ingestion. This aids in troubleshooting and correcting data formatting issues.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes 🐛\r\n\r\n- **ILP client retry behaviour**: Fixed an issue where ILP clients would retry data insertion when encountering invalid UUID values. The client now correctly handles bad UUIDs without unnecessary retries, improving ingestion stability.\r\n\r\n- **Server crash with `first(varchar)` and `last(varchar)`**: Resolved a critical issue where using `first(varchar)` or `last(varchar)` functions could cause the server to crash. These functions now operate reliably with `VARCHAR` data types. \r\n\r\n- **Deduplication key crash fix**: Addressed a potential crash when writing data with deduplication enabled on `VARCHAR` or `STRING` columns as keys. \r\n\r\n- **Parquet `byte` column support**: Added support for `RleDictionary` encoding of `BYTE` columns in the `read_parquet()` function. This enhances compatibility with Parquet files that use this encoding scheme. \r\n\r\n- **Handling comment-only queries**: Fixed an issue where SQL queries containing only comments were not properly processed. The server now correctly handles such queries without errors. \r\n\r\n- **UUID and IPv4 in `coalesce` and `switch`**: Corrected the lack of support for `UUID` and `IPv4` literals in the `coalesce()` function and `SWITCH` statements. These functions now fully support these data types.\r\n\r\n- **Parallel `GROUP BY` race condition**: Fixed a race condition that could occur during parallel `GROUP BY` operations involving a large number of groups. \r\n\r\n- **Symbol to integer comparison fix**: Resolved a `NullPointerException` that occurred when comparing `SYMBOL` columns to integer values. Comparisons between these data types now function correctly. \r\n\r\n- **Responsive health check endpoint**: Improved the responsiveness of the health check HTTP endpoint when the server reaches its memory limit. This ensures that health checks remain reliable under memory pressure. \r\n\r\n## List of PRs\r\n* fix(ilp): ILP clients should not retry when inserting a bad UUID value by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4934\r\n* feat(ilp): ILP client allows to cancel the current row by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4936\r\n* feat(sql): add spread_bps function for finance by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4939\r\n* feat(sql): add greatest and least functions by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4940\r\n* fix(sql): fix NPE when using CTEs and compiling an async group by factory by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4929\r\n* perf(core): introduce static metadata cache by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4848\r\n* fix(core): breaking change 💥 - demote some info logs to debug logs by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4944\r\n* fix(sql): first(varchar) and last(varchar) functions can crash server by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4947\r\n* fix(core): fix potential crash when writing with dedup key on on varchar, string column key by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4966\r\n* fix(sql): add RleDictionary encoding support for byte columns in the read_parquet function by @eugenels in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4984\r\n* fix(ilp): add error message in server log about the line that caused receive buffer overflow by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4987\r\n* feat(sql): add interval SQL functions for easy-to-use today, tomorrow, yesterday time filters by @nwoolmer and @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4968\r\n* fix(core): improve compatibility with log-readers by adding config option for verbose log levels by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4950\r\n* fix(sql): support comment-only query by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4983\r\n* perf(sql): reduce unnecessary TableReader partition reloads by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5010\r\n* feat(sql): string_distinct_agg function by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5000\r\n* fix(sql): missing UUID and IPv4 literal support in coalesce function and switch statement by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5017\r\n* fix(sql): race in parallel group by with many groups by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5018\r\n* perf(sql): avoid redundant bytecode generation in parallel GROUP BY by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5023\r\n* chore(sql): fix non-timezone aware test by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5008\r\n* fix(sql): NullPointerException in symbol to int comparison by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4993\r\n* feat(ilp): add ILP traffic volume metrics - TCP, HTTP by @vss96 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5004\r\n* fix(core): make health check http endpoint responsive when memory limit is reached by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5014\r\n* fix(sql): bug in SAMPLE BY queries after a query cache hit by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4990\r\n* fix(core): fix db random crash after inserting into a table with varchar dedup key by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5030\r\n* fix(core): do not reports APFS as unsupported on MacOS 15 - Sequoia by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5032\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @vss96 made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/5004\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/compare/8.1.1...8.1.2",

    "text": "# Release 8.1.1 (8.1.1)\n\n## QuestDB 8.1.1\r\n\r\nBack to school... Baaack to school... \r\n\r\nLunch? Check. Pants? Check (phew!) New QuestDB release? Oh yeah.\r\n\r\nLet's go! 📚 ✏️ 🥪 \r\n\r\n## Breaking changes 💥\r\n\r\nWe have changed the language in our `SNAPSHOT` related SQL statements. We introduce `CHECKPOINT`. \r\n\r\nApply it before taking a backup. \r\n\r\nInstead of executing:\r\n \r\n ```sql\r\n  SNAPSHOT PREPARE\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n You will now execute:\r\n  \r\n```sql\r\nCHECKPOINT CREATE\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the backup is complete, instead of executing:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nSNAPSHOT COMPLETE\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will execute:\r\n  \r\n```sql\r\n  CHECKPOINT RELEASE\r\n```\r\n\r\n Both commands are supported for now, but we encourage you to migrate to the new system.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWe have also introduced a fix for integer overflow, which now widens the type of the result. \r\n\r\nFor example, the following will be automatically widened to `LONG` (64bit) to avoid numeric overflow:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nselect 799990090 * 100000\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Improvements 🚀 \r\n\r\n- General improvements to database stability\r\n- Out-of-the-box ingress performance improved via reduced resource contention\r\n- SQL execution performance improvements for cases like `ORBER BY <long>`, and GROUP BY with virtual columns such as `now()`\r\n- Certain `ASOF` SQL queries have improved their performance by orders of magnitude\r\n- Support for `VARCHAR` and `STRING` as deduplication keys.\r\n\r\n## Pull requests\r\n\r\n* fix(sql): add support for filling weeks ('w') in SAMPLE BY queries by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4812\r\n*

    "text": "# Release 8.0.3 (8.0.3)\n\nSummer time! 🌞 For some, that's sunshine, beaches, lotion, all that fun stuff. Or, well, hiding inside near the air conditioner. It's hot! For QuestDB, it's another set of improvements. This release contains a bundle of smaller improvements, with new features laying down major groundwork. And - of course - the usual motion of performance improvements. Hot indeed. 🔥 \r\n\r\nUpgrade! Apply liberal amounts of sun screen! \r\n\r\n### Breaking Changes 💥 \r\n\r\n- **QuestDB no longer supports FreeBSD**. We test major browser versions on each release. That means everything we write needs to account for multiple OS paradigms. FreeBSD has very small market share, and more often than not we'd trip over edge cases. To speed things up, we've made the decision to drop support. This means FreeBSD is no longer tested during development.\r\n\r\n- **NFS is an unsupported file system**. NFS has been unsupported for some time, but only warnings were presented to the user. QuestDB will now refuse to start if running on an NFS disk. We recommend using ZFS. For a full list of supported filesystems, check out the [Capacity Planning documentation](https://questdb.io/docs/deployment/capacity-planning/#supported-filesystems).\r\n\r\n ### New Features 🐣 \r\n  \r\n- **JSON Support:** The json_extract() function is our first step towards robust JSON support. This function leverages the wonderful [simdjson](https://github.com/simdjson/simdjson) library written by [Daniel Lemire](https://github.com/lemire). Simply store documents in a `VARCHAR` column, and then use the function to extract JSON fields into values. There is some performance overhead versus our native format, so we recommend using it to as a way to test a schema before putting the data into native columns. Read more in [the documentation](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/function/json/).\r\n\r\n- **New financial SQL Functions:** mid price function and spread function for financial calculations. Simple. But effective. \r\n\r\n- **Smarter Web Console:** Vague errors aren't helpful. The Web Console will now help you to troubleshoot common database configuration problems, with clear visual indicators to help you identify and resolve issues.\r\n\r\n- **More parallel execution:** Enhanced `GROUP BY` operations and parallel execution, particularly benefiting queries with aggregate functions such as `avg()` and `sum()`. \r\n\r\n- **HTTP Basic Authentication:** QuestDB Open Source now offers Basic Auth to protect its HTTP endpoints.

    "text": "# Release 8.0.0 (8.0.0)\n\nThis one's a big one! \r\n\r\nIn brief, to get you to the goods quicker:\r\n\r\n* New VARCHAR data type over STRING default for ++compression & ++performance\r\n* 50% improvement over already fast SQL query performance\r\n* Data compression via system-level ZFS, previously Enterprise-only\r\n\r\nAnd more...\r\n\r\nUpgrade as soon as you can. Or start fresh and build out your use case.\r\n\r\n_If you're still reading, onwards for more detail, breaking changes, plus the PR breakdown._\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### New features 🐣\r\n\r\n- **VARCHAR:** Introduces the `VARCHAR` data type and a new type driver API. `VARCHAR` offers UTF8 encoded strings of variable length as opposed to the UTF16 and fixed length encoding found in `STRING`, for better compression and significantly improved performance. \r\n  - Maximum size of a single `VARCHAR` field size is 268 MB. \r\n  - A size of a `VARCHAR` column in a single partition is limited by 218 TB or disk size, whichever is smaller. \r\n  - `STRING` is now considered a legacy type.\r\n- **Data compression:** Data compression for OSS! Full support for the ZFS file system and system-level data compression. \r\n  - Read [our guide](https://questdb.io/docs/guides/compression-zfs/) to setup ZFS.\r\n- **ALTER COLUMN type:** Use [ALTER TABLE SQL](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/sql/alter-table-change-column-type) to convert column types. \r\n  - Migrate between `STRING`, `SYMBOL`, and `VARCHAR` data types.\r\n\r\n### Breaking changes 💥\r\n\r\n- **GLIBC upgrade:** Upgraded GLIBC to a minimum of 2.28-amd64 and 2.33-aarch64.\r\n- **ILP and TextImport changes:** ILP and TextImport now create `VARCHAR` instead of `STRING` columns.\r\n- **Jemalloc allocator:** The default allocator is now jemalloc. Later updates include disabling jemalloc as the default allocator and removing jemalloc from no-jre builds.\r\n\r\n### Performance 🚀\r\n\r\n- **SQL performance improvement:** Average SQL performance improves by 50%. 🔥 \r\n- **Memory allocation limit:** New memory allocation limit prevents OS OOM handler terminations in many cases.\r\n\r\n### Bug fixes 🥾\r\n\r\n- **SQL:** Fixed issues with SAMPLE BY and GROUP BY not grouping when used with column aliases. Fixed WHERE filters with FLOAT columns null comparison.\r\n- **Core:** Addressed trailing boundary processing of multipart HTTP requests. Fixed hour parsing and formatting in the 1-12 and 1-24 conventions.\r\n\r\n### Pull requests :octocat:\r\n\r\n* perf(sql): improve performance of length(VARCHAR) by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4442\r\n* perf(sql): reduce query latency when querying tables under heavy writing by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4500\r\n* perf(sql): statistics-based map pre-sizing for parallel group by by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4517\r\n* perf(sql): speed up GROUP BY queries with ORDER BY and LIMIT by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4523\r\n* perf(sql): optimize ORDER BY with LIMIT by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4529\r\n* perf(sql): adaptive work stealing for parallel query execution on multicore machines by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4542\r\n* feat(core): breaking change💥  - upgrade GLIBC to minimum of 2.28-amd64 and 2.33-aarch64 by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4449\r\n* feat(core): use jemalloc allocator by default by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4451\r\n* feat(sql): implement level 2 order book price function by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4462\r\n* feat(core): add ZFS support by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4507\r\n* feat(sql): support usage of ALTER table SQL to convert column types by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4413\r\n* feat(ilp): breaking change💥 - ILP and TextImport create VARCHAR instead of STRING columns by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4476\r\n* feat(build): new ami based on amazon linux 2023 💥 - breaking change by @mariusgheorghies in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4519\r\n* feat(core): resume all suspended WAL tables on start up by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4513\r\n* feat(core): add RSS memory limit to prevent OOM kills from the OS by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4480\r\n* feat(sql): introduce global select query cache per interface by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4525\r\n* feat(core): improve SQL error logging by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4532\r\n* fix(sql): fix sample by query compilation error when using as-of join by @amunra in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4452\r\n* fix(core): fix trailing boundary processing of multipart HTTP requests by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4466\r\n* fix(http): remove `ddl:ok` response for insert query by @siddharth0815 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4472\r\n* fix(ui): web console to load regardless of pgwire disabled by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4484\r\n* fix(sql): fix WHERE filters with FLOAT columns null comparison by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4487\r\n* fix(sql): minor bug fixes in ExpressionParser by @sivukhin in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4441\r\n* fix(sql): IN with NULLs and STRINGs sometimes may return the wrong result by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4499\r\n* fix(sql): fix SAMPLE BY and GROUP BY not grouping when used with column aliases by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4503\r\n* fix(core): fix hour parsing and formatting in the 1-12 and 1-24 conventions by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4506\r\n* fix(sql): fix several bugs in aggregation (avg/sum/first_value) window functions by @sivukhin in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4429\r\n* fix(sql): split_part returning old data when no match is found by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4493\r\n* fix(sql): breaking💥 fix coalesce function correctness by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4490\r\n* fix(core): fix potential data loss when non-WAL table dropped and created with same name by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4533\r\n* fix(sql): breaking change💥 - fix expression parser operator precedence by @sivukhin in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4443\r\n* fix(core): fix transient query failure because of missing partition directory by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4611\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @siddharth0815 made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4472\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/compare/7.4.2...8.0.0",

But isn't it nice when a clear, happy path emerges?\r\n\r\nTo that tune, we're pleased to announce QuestDB 7.4.2, with the usual mix of features, fixes and improvements. \r\n\r\nIn focus this week is the refinement of our updated ingestion clients. Built atop the InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP) and leveraging HTTP instead of TCP, our clients and core database now offer a primary ingestion path that is robust, responsive and fast. They're available in popular languages, including Rust, Python, Java, Go, C & C++, and more.\r\n\r\nIt is quicker, cleaner and clearer to both [get started](https://questdb.io/docs/ingestion-overview/) and refine.\r\n\r\n### New Features 🐣 \r\n\r\n_Fresh goods._\r\n\r\n* Added bind variable support for long256 and IPv4 operators, milliseconds and microseconds support to datediff and dateadd.\r\n\r\n* Enabled FILL(LINEAR) to support ALIGN TO CALENDAR.\r\n \r\n### Performance 🚀 \r\n\r\n_Always a category unto its own._\r\n\r\n* **ILP**: Optimized data ingestion for tables with a large number of columns.\r\n\r\n* **Core**: Improved hash table lookup for small string keys and optimized memory usage to reduce OS kills.\r\n\r\n* **SQL**: Faster SQL COPY and REST API CSV import, optimized binary search corner cases, and fixed the stuck parallel GROUP BY queries via better query timeout handling.\r\n\r\n### Bug Fixes 🥾 \r\n\r\n_Squished, squashed & kiboshed._\r\n\r\n* **ILP**: Addressed 'maximum buffer size exceeded' in ILP client and made config adjustments to disable individual flush types and support auto_flush_bytes. also corrected client processing of data received before TLS close_notification.\r\n\r\n* **SQL**: Fixed incorrect results from lower, upper, substring functions when executed in parallel, erroneous SAMPLE BY behavior mixing asterisks, errors in CASE statements when ELSE branch is missing, incorrect results in GROUP BY queries, and SAMPLE BY queries with functions in the SELECT clause.\r\n\r\n    Also fixed a bug for negative upper bound in BETWEEN operator, issues with null string insertions as designated timestamps, and inaccurate double comparisons. Finally, resolved stuck parallel group by queries due to incorrect timeout handling.\r\n\r\n* **Core**: Addressed a rare segmentation fault during o3 commit of a non-WAL table, potential error rebuilding nascent data index, and incorrect partition size after an update.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors 🎉 \r\n \r\n@hoangsvit and @sivukhin made their first contributions.

Sunshine, flowers, all that nice stuff. \r\n\r\nAs the wheels of the seasons turn, so to the wheels of the applications we're all busy building. \r\n\r\nHopefully good things bloom for us all.\r\n\r\n**QuestDB is pleased to release version 7.4!**\r\n\r\nAs you've come to expect, this release further improves core database performance. Also as per usual, several bugs and rough edges have been addressed. In important addition, there are **note-able breaking changes** that will provide a smoother overall experience and set us up well for future changes. Please address them prior to upgrade, and reach out to us if you run into any issues.\r\n\r\n## ⚠️ **New Features with breaking changes** \r\n\r\n- `SAMPLE BY` queries now use `ALIGN TO CALENDAR` by default. As such, if you're using `SAMPLE BY` and expecting `ALIGN TO FIRST OBSERVATION`, you'll need to [update your queries](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/sql/sample-by/#align-to-keywords) to specify that syntax.\r\n\r\n- **Java client:** The ILP Sender used in our first-party Java client now requires an explicit selection of Transport, (HTTP or TCP) for enhanced reliability and clarity in data ingestion workflows. You will need to pass this value forward. See [the PR](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4293) for more information. If you do not use the Java client, but use another language client, see your respective language client repository and update if needed.\r\n\r\n- `CREATE TABLE AS` and `INSERT INTO SELECT` statements now operate non-atomically and are batched by default. If you require an atomic table, you can now use the very powerful sounding: `CREATE ATOMIC TABLE`.  For more information, checkout [the docs](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/sql/create-table/#create-table-as).\r\n\r\n## 🚀 Performance Improvements\r\n\r\nThis release improves parallel `GROUP BY` query performance and also makes `SAMPLE BY` queries more efficient. In addition, we've reduced thread-local allocator overhead in single-threaded `GROUP BY` & `SAMPLE BY` queries. The first/last aggregate functions for string columns have also been optimized.\r\n\r\n## 🐛 Bug Fixes\r\n\r\n- Resolved issues leading to segmentation faults and incorrect results in certain SQL queries involving GROUP BY and SAMPLE BY clauses.\r\n- Addressed a bug that could cause a table to be omitted from snapshots after significant DDL changes.\r\n- Fixed HTTP request handling to prevent rejections when content-length is set to 0.\r\n- Solved potential TLS handshake stalls on MacOS.\r\n- Corrected the behavior of altering tables to add indexes that could inadvertently remove deduplication keys.\r\n- Eliminated a crash during ingestion and various other stability issues.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n\r\n* fix(sql): potential incorrect results in non-keyed parallel GROUP BY query by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4234\r\n* fix(sql): segfault when running SAMPLE BY query with index-based filter and last/first functions by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4233\r\n* fix(core): fix an issue where a table was not being included in the snapshot due to significant DDL changes being applied. by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4245\r\n* fix(http): fix rejects of HTTP GET requests when content-length set to 0 by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4242\r\n* fix(core): TLS handshake might occasionally get stuck on MacOS by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4269\r\n* fix(sql): fix incorrect unordered map creation check by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4255\r\n* perf(sql): parallel GROUP BY support for first/last functions by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4267\r\n* fix(sql): fix altering table to add index can remove dedup key by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4270\r\n* feat(sql): parallel `sample by` implementation by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4259\r\n* perf(sql): speed up first/last aggregate functions for string columns by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4276\r\n* fix(sql): fix a bug in indexed symbol comparison by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4273\r\n* fix(core): fix wal table is suspended after invalid drop partition SQL by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4272\r\n* fix(core): fix double-free in text loader by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4278\r\n* perf(sql): avoid redundant parsing of UUID bind variables by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4281\r\n* feat(sql): breaking change💥 - change default behaviour of SAMPLE BY to ALIGN TO CALENDAR instead of ALIGN TO FIRST OBSERVATION by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4277\r\n* fix(core): fix possible crash during ingestion (fuzz) by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4286\r\n* fix(sql): qualified names in ORDER BY join queries no longer cause AssertionError by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4274\r\n* perf(sql): remove thread-local allocator access overhead in single-threaded GROUP BY/SAMPLE BY queries by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4271\r\n* feat(ilp): breaking change💥 - ILP Sender requires explicit Transport selection by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4293\r\n* fix(core): fix ignored JVM arguments in AMI by @petr-tichy in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4258\r\n* fix(http): send http timeout response instead of disconnect on long csv export by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4300\r\n* feat(sql): breaking change💥 - change default behaviour of CREATE TABLE AS/INSERT INTO SELECT statements to be non-atomic and batched by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4287\r\n* fix(sql): fix potentially incorrect values produced by LPad/RPad functions by @eugenels in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4327\r\n* fix(sql): fix ILIKE for upper case non-ASCII patterns by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4321\r\n* fix(sql): fix occasional failures with first()/last()/first_not_null()/last_not_null() direct string function by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4324\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @petr-tichy made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4258\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/compare/7.3.10...7.4.0",

    "text": "# Release 7.3.10 (7.3.10)\n\n# Fresh from QuestDB 🐲 \r\n\r\nThe 2024 Lunar New Year marks the Year of the Dragon. 🐉 When you think of the mighty dragon, what comes to mind? For us, well, we're a little different. Dragons evoke strength, wisdom, and - naturally - wild performance (we're performance obsessed). \r\n\r\nWithin that theme, the 7.3.10 release offers a 5x-10x speed-up in `ASOF` and `LT JOIN` queries, as well as a number of optimizations in parallel filters, `GROUP BY`, and within the JIT compiler. Further, `UUID` and `LONG256` columns are now supported by parallel `GROUP BY` for efficient use of all hardware resources. For workloads that feature small, but frequent transactions you'll also see improved performance.\r\n\r\nFamiliar with InfluxDB? Interested in using InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP), but with something more robust under-the-hood? This release provides 5x faster ingestion performance when multiple connections are in use, further increasing overall throughput strength compared to InfluxDB, especially in data with high cardinality. Whether you're looking to leverage ILP for high performance streaming, or upgrading an existing InfluxDB workload over to QuestDB, this update makes it easier.\r\n\r\n> Read more about \"drop-in\" InfluxDB migration in our [recent blog](https://questdb.io/blog/replace-influxdb/).\r\n\r\nAlongside the usual battery of bug fixes, this release also includes a new HyperLogLog-based `approx_count_distinct()` SQL function that is 3x-5x faster and more memory efficient than the existing `count_distinct()` function for high cardinality data sets. And finally, Write-Ahead Log (WAL) enabled tables are now the default table type. This means that the benefits of WAL & WAL-required features like deduplication are available to each newly created table.\r\n\r\nWhether you're new to QuestDB, working in prod, or migrating existing time series workloads, this release has something for you.\r\n\r\n## Performance improvements\r\n\r\n* perf(sql): support uuid and long256 in parallel GROUP BY by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4140\r\n* perf(sql): avoid redundant disk reads in ORDER BY + LIMIT queries with parallel filter by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4148\r\n* perf(sql): use JIT compiled filter in parallel GROUP BY by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4138\r\n* perf(sql): speed up GROUP BY and JOIN in case of very small fixed-size keys by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4134\r\n* perf(sql): add JIT compilation support for string/binary null check by @mtopolnik in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4177\r\n* perf(sql): improve parallel group by detection when aliasing columns by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4190\r\n* perf(sql): avoid full table scan in ASOF and LT JOIN with no additional columns by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4199\r\n* perf(ilp): fix ingress perf issue for small, but frequent transactions by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4221\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n* feat(ilp): make ILP over HTTP transactional for single table by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4110\r\n* feat(ilp): ILP client supports HTTP as a transport by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4111\r\n* feat(ilp): Influx Line Protocol client configuration via strings by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4166\r\n* feat(conf): add new configuration settings to server.conf (including Enterprise settings) by @amunra in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4175\r\n* feat(sql): add approx_count_distinct() SQL function by @piotrrzysko in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4083\r\n* feat(core): enable WAL tables by default by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4223\r\n\r\n## Fixes and other improvements\r\n\r\n* fix(http): fix CSV import for files larger than 2GB by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4132\r\n* fix(http): fix HTTP protocol errors following non-successful requests by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4125\r\n* fix(core): fix database stuck on startup after some table drops by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4152\r\n* fix(core): fix wal resume exception after table suspended because of an error by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4162\r\n* fix(core): communicate posix_fallocate's return value via errno by @eugenels in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4158\r\n* fix(sql): fix exception when running insert as select by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4157\r\n* fix(core): fix invalid table writer state after ALTER TABLE SQUASH PARTITIONS by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4153\r\n* fix(core): disable query cancellation and timeout in WAL apply job by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4176\r\n* fix(sql): fix NullPointerException in LATEST ON with nested query by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4192\r\n* fix(core): fix errors / data inconsistencies after restoring from a snapshot by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4205\r\n* fix(sql): enable parallel group-by on servers with fewer than 4 cores by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4208\r\n* fix(core): fix snapshot restore to correctly restore tables when snapshot is taken under heavy DDL load by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4212\r\n* fix(pgwire): fix a memory leak when using prepared statement and UUID columns by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4214\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @mtopolnik made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4177\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/compare/7.3.9...7.3.10",

(If you had one...) \r\n\r\nIn the latest QuestDB release, we've focused on enhanced stability and introduced two innovative features. Notably, we've improved `GROUP BY` performance tenfold through parallel SQL executions and introduced InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP) support over HTTP, which is compatible with existing InfluxDB drivers. Those familiar with ILP will find a clean entryway into QuestDB.\r\n\r\nThanks to @ssharaev and @pompeiifreckles for their first contributions - we appreciate you. \r\n\r\nDive in to explore the release in detail. 🤿 \r\n\r\n# What's changed\r\n\r\n- **10x `GROUP BY` performance improvement via parallel SQL executions**. Should you encounter any problems with this implementation, you can safely disabled `[cairo.sql.parallel.groupby.enabled=false]` it via configuration without downgrading the database instance.\r\n- **InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP) support over HTTP**. This implementation supports existing InfluxDB drivers and eases the transition into QuestDB for existing ILP users. The new client has control over transaction boundaries and will offer helpful feedback on transaction activity. We're also pleased to offer no noticeable performance impact in ingestions performance compared to our TCP implementation.\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n* feat(sql): add sign() functions by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4050\r\n* feat(ilp): ILP over HTTP, InfluxDB native clients writing support, ILP feedback by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4034\r\n* feat(sql): add `nullif(double, double)` SQL function by @ssharaev in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4063\r\n* perf(sql): parallel group by with optional filtering by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4032\r\n* feat(sql): add query registry and query cancellation by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4066\r\n* perf(sql): support advanced aggregate functions in parallel GROUP BY by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4097\r\n* feat(http): add createTable parameter to /imp by @nwoolmer in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4108\r\n* perf(sql): speed up GROUP BY queries with small fixed-size keys by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4128\r\n\r\n### Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n* fix(sql): fix handling of keyed string aggregation of first(), first_not_null(), last(), last_not_null() functions by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4068\r\n* fix(core): fix non-existing partition drop can suspend WAL table by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4064\r\n* fix(ilp): ilp@http small fixes by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4077\r\n* fix(sql): implement 'case expression when value' for float and double data types by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4046\r\n* fix(sql): fix NullPointerException in replace() function with symbol arguments by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4073\r\n* fix(core): fix tables() function permanently returning error after some DDLs by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4081\r\n* fix(core): fix potential and unlikely numeric overlflow that could lead to incorrect query results by @pompeiifreckles in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4093\r\n* fix(sql): fix potential races when regexp_replace function is used in where or group by clause by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4102\r\n* fix(core): fix non-partitioned table corruption caused by `truncate` & table corruption after restore from snapshot by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4095\r\n* fix(core): fix edge case error when importing a large CSV file @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4103\r\n* fix(sql): unregister query on cursor initialization failure by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4113\r\n* fix(core): fix non-partition table truncate not working correctly alter table add column by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4109\r\n* fix(core): reduce unnecessary error logging when table is dropped by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4121\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n\r\n* @ssharaev made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4063\r\n* @pompeiifreckles made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/4093\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/compare/7.3.7...7.3.8",

Not be left behind, queries also keep getting faster. In benchmarks, recent performance optimizations have shown 50% improvement to several query types.\r\n\r\n### New features\r\n\r\n* feat(core): config to limit RSS memory used for writing by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3937\r\n* feat(core): print insufficient Linux kernel limits on start-up by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3980\r\n* feat(sql): implement approx_percentile function by @kevinmingtarja in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3900\r\n* feat(sql): string_agg function support in keyed group by queries by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3991\r\n* feat(sql): add first_not_null and last_not_null functions for GeoHash and IPv4 data types by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3929\r\n* feat(sql) add `show server_version` by @nitram509 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3901\r\n* feat(sql): add `show parameters` SQL by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3972\r\n* perf(sql): optimize count_distinct symbol function by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3974\r\n\r\n### Fixes and improvements\r\n\r\n* fix(sql): fix segfault in aggregate vectorized functions on zero input length by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3944\r\n* fix(sql): maintain timestamp metadata in window factories by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3940\r\n* fix(core): introduce separate settings for WAL writer pool by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3948\r\n* fix(sql): improve count(*) and limit x,y performance by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3951\r\n* fix(sql): fix create table like with dedup by @brunocalza in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3964\r\n* fix(sql): fix several small sql issues  by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3970\r\n* fix(core): fix UPDATE timeout can leave non-WAL table in half updated state by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3946\r\n* fix(core): reduce disk and memory footprint of system tables by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3945\r\n* fix(core): recognize XFS file system as supported by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3968\r\n* fix(core): handling of unexpected errors in SQL execution by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3963\r\n",

And even more good looking.  😎 \r\n\r\nHighlighting our latest release:\r\n \r\n* [**Window functions**](https://questdb.io/docs/reference/function/window/). These flexible functions provide moving averages, running totals, or Top-N results within a group, and more via a \"window\", defined by an `OFFSET` against a `RANGE` or `ROWS`. Unlike aggregate functions, window functions do not cause rows to become grouped into a single output row — the rows retain their separate identities. Additional perks? Performance and an easing of query complexity.\r\n\r\n* **More functions.** We've added:`first(boolean)`, `last(boolean)`, `first(string)`, `last(string)`, mathematical exponent `exp(D)` and `first_not_null()`, `last_not_null()`, which operate on most nullable data types, except IPv4 and GeoHash.\r\n\r\n* **Performance.** Our goal is top performance. `LIKE`/`ILIKE` queries now perform over 80% faster.\r\n\r\n* **Web Console Refresh.** The best tools provide the help that you need without getting in your way. We've tuned the Web Console UI to put what you need closer to where you need it.  Less used UI elements have had their significance reduced and overall navigation has been streamlined. On top of that, a discrete news feed will send you all the latest, so that you don't miss a beat.\r\n\r\n**Before:** \r\n\r\n<img width=\"660\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-11-07 at 1 00 40 PM\"

    "text": "# Release 7.3 (7.3)\n\n## Overview\r\n\r\n#### Data deduplication\r\n\r\nThis release includes the highly anticipated data deduplication logic, which is now supported across all ingestion protocols. Its primary objective is to simplify the process of restarting data streams. If a data stream is interrupted, clients can easily resolve the issue by re-publishing an arbitrarily long window of data. The server will then handle the task of retaining only the missing data.\r\n\r\nData deduplication functions as an upsert operation by preserving the newer version of a record when duplicates are encountered.\r\n\r\nTo control data deduplication the following SQL syntax is available:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- deduplicate on 2 columns\r\nCREATE TABLE no_ts_dups_table (timestamp ts, l long, symbol sym, uuid id, string s) timestamps(ts) \r\nPARTITION BY DAY WAL \r\nDEDUPLICATE UPSERT KEYS(ts, id)\r\n\r\n-- deduplication on 3 columns\r\nALTER TABLE no_ts_dups_table DEDUP UPSERT KEYS(ts, id, l);\r\n\r\n-- deduplication on 4 columns\r\nALTER TABLE no_ts_dups_table DEDUP UPSERT KEYS(ts, sym, id, l);\r\n```\r\nWe are thrilled to assure you that data deduplication has a negligible impact on ingestion performance, allowing it to be enabled at all times.\r\n\r\n#### New `IPV4` data type\r\n\r\nThis release introduces a new data type called ipv4. The primary objective behind this addition is to assist users working with IPv4 addresses in alleviating storage constraints and enhancing the overall SQL execution performance. Please see this [the original pull request](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3523) for more details.\r\n\r\n## What is new\r\n\r\n#### CORE\r\n\r\n* data deduplication by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3524, https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3566\r\n* add `ipv4` as supported column type by @allegraharris in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3523\r\n* enable prepending jvm flags from docker run by @yifanstefanwang in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3567\r\n* make wal apply more fair in case of skewed transaction frequences by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3592\r\n\r\n#### SQL\r\n\r\n* implement function to convert two longs to UUID by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3559\r\n\r\n## What is fixed\r\n\r\n#### CORE\r\n\r\n* fix wal to non-wal table conversion leaving table non-writable by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3572\r\n* fix physical rows written metric on partition split by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3577\r\n* fix vacuum command deleting live table columns by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3589\r\n\r\n#### SQL\r\n\r\n* fix exception updating symbol column with char value by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3578\r\n* unexpected NullPointerException on COUNT(SELECT ...) query by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3565\r\n* fix sql bugs by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3479\r\n* fix data loss causes by concurrent column drop transactions by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3583\r\n* fix race condition in ILP authentication by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3599\r\n* fix Invalid Column error with multiple JOIN by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3604\r\n* limit reordering of left join-ed tables by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3606\r\n* fix `string` and `char` comparison by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3607\r\n\r\n#### UI\r\n\r\n* fix incorrect rendering of last few columns in Web Console grid\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @auula made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3593\r\n* @yifanstefanwang made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3567\r\n* @allegraharris made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3523\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/compare/7.2.1...7.3",

    "title": "Release 7.2",
    "text": "# Release 7.2 (7.2)\n\n## Overview\r\n\r\nIn QuestDB 7.2, we address a key issue faced by our users regarding write amplification and performance under heavy loads.\r\n\r\nPreviously, QuestDB utilized fixed-size time partitions to store data in ascending chronological order. However, this approach resulted in write amplification, particularly towards the end of each time interval. To tackle this problem, we have introduced implicit variable-size time partitions in this release.\r\n\r\n#### Before\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/assets/7276403/6d9de0cb-1089-4fa9-8a11-19e1f45f541d)\r\n\r\n\r\n#### After\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/assets/7276403/fb79ab77-f937-4bb8-9565-9731b97f877b)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new feature intelligently splits partitions at strategic points, ensuring smaller partition sizes and reducing the surface area for copy-on-write operations. This minimizes write amplification and maintains high write performance, even during heavy load scenarios.\r\n\r\nTo further optimize the system, we have implemented a sophisticated statistical model to balance the split and squash logic. As a result, partitions statistically unlikely to be modified again are asynchronously squashed, reducing the number of files on disk and alleviating stress on the OS metadata catalog.\r\n\r\nWrite amplification is reduced by orders of magnitude. Users can now experience sustained write performance, even in demanding environments.\r\n\r\n## Gotchas\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change. If you decide to downgrade from this release, partitions, created by 7.2 may not be understood by earlier versions. To proceed with the downgrade you may need to \"squash\" partitions on each table. To do that, run the following SQL _before_ the downgrade:\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nALTER TABLE <tab> SQUASH PARTITIONS\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What is new\r\n\r\n#### SQL\r\n\r\n- add auxiliary meta functions to support integration with third party library superset by @marregui in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3390\r\n- add string comparison operator by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3458\r\n- support squashing partitions using SQL by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3328\r\n\r\n#### ILP\r\n\r\n- adjust ILP msg buffer size to max measurement size if needed by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3408\r\n\r\n#### UI\r\n\r\n- refresh file status when Import page is back in view by @insmac in https://github.com/questdb/ui/pull/151\r\n- support adding duplicate filenames in Import by @insmac in https://github.com/questdb/ui/pull/155\r\n\r\n## What is fixed\r\n\r\n#### CORE\r\n- fix rare / by 0 error in WAL table writing by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3375\r\n- fix WAL segment housekeeping edge case leading to a failure to write to WAL table  by @amunra in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3381\r\n- increase max open files limit on MacOS by @bowen-xu in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3416\r\n- fix stuck writing on rare concurrency condition by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3446\r\n- fix incorrect truncation of WAL table partition leading to read errors by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3451\r\n- fix wal apply error by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3460\r\n\r\n#### SQL\r\n\r\n- fix splice join validation by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3380\r\n- fix value in list issues by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3382\r\n- fix NullPointerException in GROUP BY query with ORDER BY expression by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3425\r\n- fix StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in sub-select parsing by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3427\r\n- fix AssertionError in SAMPLE BY and GROUP BY queries over symbol columns by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3422\r\n- fix join column propagation by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3421\r\n- improve error reporting on non-boolean join conditions by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3404\r\n- fix AssertionError in repeated LT/ASOF join by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3430\r\n- fix order by column resolution by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3426\r\n- fix ClassCastException in symbol IN cursor operator by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3457\r\n- allow bind variables in \"string IN\" values list by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3448\r\n- fix disconnect on sql case statement with one condition and no else by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3397\r\n\r\n#### ILP\r\n\r\n- fix ILP errors when column deleted in middle of line processing by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3453\r\n\r\n#### HTTP\r\n\r\n- fix case sensivity in duplicate column validation of CSV import by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3444\r\n\r\n#### UI\r\n\r\n- execute a correct SELECT query after a successful import by @insmac in https://github.com/questdb/ui/pull/157\r\n- fix long file name overlap in Import queue by @insmac in https://github.com/questdb/ui/pull/150\r\n- fix an issue when the user could not paste text into form inputs, causing the drawer to close by @insmac in https://github.com/questdb/ui/pull/154\r\n- fix removing import queue entries by pasting a new file into non-empty import queue by @insmac in https://github.com/questdb/ui/pull/154\r\n\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @bowen-xu made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3416\r\n* @rohansx made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3378\r\n* @Sam-Salerno made their first contribution in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3391\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/compare/7.1.3...7.2",

    "text": "# Release 7.0.1 (7.0.1)\n\n## Overview\r\n\r\nQuestDB 7.0.1 is the production-ready implementation of our new storage type, which makes data ingestion faster and more reliable. In this release, we introduce a Write-Ahead-Log (WAL) to ingest data. Newly created tables will now be WAL tables by default. Existing tables will use legacy storage until explicitly migrated to a new storage type.\r\n\r\n## 🚀 WAL Storage new features\r\n- Ingestion throughput is 3x higher, as benchmarked on the [Time Series Benchmarking Suite](https://github.com/timescale/tsbs) with twelve threads.  \r\n- Concurrent writing via all interfaces. Issues such as https://github.com/questdb/questdb/issues/1461 are now solved\r\n- Foundational groundwork for High Availability: Replication will work with WAL tables only\r\n\r\n## Benchmark\r\n\r\nBelow are our latest benchmark results using the Time Series Benchmarking Suite:\r\n\r\n- Benchmark: CPU-only\r\n- Hardware: 32CPUs, 64GB RAM\r\n\r\nThe ingestion rate is measured in rows per second:\r\n\r\n  | QuestDB 7.0 | influxDB 1.8.10 | TimescaleDB 2.10 (tuned)\r\n-- | -- | -- | --\r\n4 workers | 1.458M | 0.181M | 0.304M\r\n8 workers | 2.874M | 0.306M | 0.464M\r\n12 workers | 4.155M | 0.372M | 0.517M\r\n16 workers | 4.373M | 0.375M | 0.510M\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to migrate from existing legacy tables to WAL-tables\r\nTo create a WAL-based table, the following syntax should be used (note `WAL` at the end):\r\n\r\n```questdb-sql\r\ncreate table ABC(x int, t timestamp) timestamp(t) partition by day WAL;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also convert your existing table to WAL (followed by an instance restart). The conversion touches table configuration (not data!) and is fully reversible.\r\n\r\nTo convert an existing table to WAL:\r\n- `alter table ABC set type WAL;`\r\n- restart instance\r\n\r\nTo convert a WAL table to a non-WAL table:\r\n- `alter table ABC set type bypass WAL;`\r\n- restart instance\r\n\r\n## What is new\r\n\r\n#### CORE\r\n- make WAL tables default on fresh install by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2987\r\n- add external configuration for lag calculation window size by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3025\r\n\r\n#### SQL\r\n\r\n- allow list of timestamps of higher precision than required in alter table attach/detach/drop partition  by @marregui in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3002\r\n- extend create table statement syntax to support \"IN VOLUME volume-alias\" by @marregui in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2931\r\n\r\n#### HTTP\r\n\r\n- JSON endpoint returns index of designated timestamp column, which is being used by the Web Console by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2969\r\n\r\n#### UI\r\n- made column type a subtext in column header by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2973\r\n- column header is a little taller by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2973\r\n- new header look and feel by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2973\r\n- new \"drag handles\" by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2973\r\n- designated timestamp columns is highlighted in green by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2973\r\n- column resize fixed as in when columns get narrower and by that do not fill entire viewport - the virtual cells are re-rendered and subsequent glitches fixed by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2973\r\n- column width is rendered based on first 1000 rows of data by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2973\r\n- column name is using ellipsis when it does not fit in column by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2973\r\n- column resize uses ghost bar to improve resize performance on complicated grids by @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2973\r\n\r\n## What we fixed\r\n\r\n#### CORE\r\n- Table type conversion SQL was not processed via REST API by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2963\r\n- Reset transaction number on non-WAL to WAL table conversion by @glasstiger in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2968\r\n- fix wal table suspension on a race condition by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3019\r\n- fix cleaning up after dropped tables by @ideoma in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3015\r\n\r\n#### SQL\r\n- fix DISTINCT combined with a column alias by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2982\r\n- fix order by removal in nested queries inside set operations by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2970\r\n- fix error on select distinct with join by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2989\r\n- fix stack overflow exception in WITH clause parsing by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2965\r\n- make sure that order by is not ignored by row_number() function by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2999\r\n- non-keyed LT JOIN could return equal timestamps by @jerrinot in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3001\r\n- improve order by handling in optimizer by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2988\r\n- fix sample by first/last keyed by non-symbol column by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2972\r\n- fix inconvertible types error when updating string column by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3005\r\n- fix (i)like with single character pattern by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3007\r\n- fix group by performance when selected columns have aliases by @puzpuzpuz in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3013\r\n- fix symbol column initialization in latest by cursors by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3027\r\n\r\n#### ILP\r\n- do not modify representation of Long.MIN_VALUE sent over ILP by @eugenels in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/3011\r\n\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/compare/7.0.0...7.0.1",

This release provides a comprehensive solution to that. \r\n\r\nThe reasons why you should switch to WAL are:\r\n\r\n- Consistent ingestion performance, unaffected by out-of-order data processing (2x performance increase on ILP)\r\n- Concurrent writing via all interfaces. Issues like #1461 are solved for WAL tables.\r\n- Enables future work on replication. Replication will work with WAL tables only.\r\n\r\nThe WAL storage model is inactive by default. To create a WAL-based table, the following syntax should be used (note `WAL` at the end):\r\n\r\n```questdb-sql\r\ncreate table ABC(x int, t timestamp) timestamp(t) partition by day WAL;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also convert your existing table to WAL (followed by an instance restart). The conversion touches table configuration (not data!) and is fully reversible.\r\n\r\nTo convert an existing table to WAL:\r\n\r\n- `alter table ABC set type WAL;`\r\n- restart instance\r\n\r\nTo convert a WAL table to non-WAL:\r\n\r\n- `alter table ABC set type bypass WAL;`\r\n- restart instance\r\n\r\n## What is new \r\n\r\n#### CORE\r\n\r\n- Write Ahead Log (WAL) table storage model by @ideoma, @glasstiger, @eugenels, @puzpuzpuz and @bluestreak01 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2951\r\n\r\n#### SQL\r\n\r\n- backward interval generation in IN operator by @kishansairam9 in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2943\r\n\r\n#### UI\r\n\r\n- updated Web Console from 0.0.8 to 0.0.10 (https://github.com/questdb/ui/blob/main/packages/web-console/CHANGELOG.md#0010---2023-02-03)\r\n\r\n## What we fixed\r\n\r\n#### SQL\r\n\r\n- fix incorrect results caused by SQL optimiser pushing down some filters to nested SAMPLE BY aggregation by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2945\r\n- fix async filter with cursor returning bad results by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2958\r\n- fix parsing of explain command with parenthesized queries by @bziobrowski in https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2953\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/questdb/questdb/compare/6.7...7.0.0\r\n",

    "text": "# Release 6.3 (6.3)\n\n## Release highlights\r\n\r\n- The [JIT compiler](https://questdb.io/blog/2022/01/12/jit-sql-compiler/) is now enabled by default. The compiler aims at significantly improving execution times for queries with simple arithmetic expressions in `where` statements. This feature can be disabled by setting `cairo.sql.jit.mode` to `off`.\r\n\r\n- The `where` clause is executed concurrently, which include both JIT-based and function framework based filters. Additionally SQL optimiser takes into account `limit` values to optimise data passes and optimise memory usage\r\n\r\n- Database `backup` via filesystem snapshot support has been added for cloud environments, e.g. AWS EBS. This enables `live` database backups to be `inexpensive` both in terms of effect on ingestion and SQL execution performance as well as cloud cost. Snapshotting is a three prong process. First, cloud administrators issue statement `SNAPSHOT PREPARE`, which locks all table readers and flushes filesystem caches to disk (through the `sync` syscall). Second, administrators can at this point invoke the snapshotting procedure, of their cloud vendor, which can be left to run for however long it needs. Third, statement `SNAPSHOT COMPLETE` is called to release the readers and should be issued as soon as possible even as the snapshot is being produced. This feature can be disabled by setting `cairo.snapshot.recovery.enabled` to `false`.\r\n\r\n- Configuration settings validation is now strict. Unsupported settings and typos cause startup failure (logs are produced with appropriate instructions on how to migrate).\r\n\r\n- Add new functionalities in the web console: SQL formatting and autocomplete table names. \r\n\r\n## Gotchas\r\n\r\n- If you upgrade 6.2.1 -> 6.3 you **cannot** go back to 6.2.1 without restoring from backup.\r\n \r\n## What is new\r\n\r\n#### Storage engine\r\n\r\n- Enable JIT compiler by default [#2090](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2090).\r\n- Add asynchronous API for chaining SQL execution components and expose concurrent `where` clause execution results [#1732](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/1732).\r\n- Add filesystem snapshotting support for cloud environments. Includes statements `SNAPSHOT PREPARE|COMPLETE` [#1907](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/1907).\r\n\r\n#### SQL\r\n\r\n- Add `cast` function to allow casts from string to boolean, e.g. `cast('true' as boolean)` [#2041](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2041).\r\n- Add `date_trunc()` function to truncate timestamps, e.g.: `date_trunc('week', '2022-05-07T02:09:30.111111Z') -> '2022-05-02 00:00:00.0'` [#2017](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2017).\r\n- Add `flush_query_cache()` function to clear all Http and PGWire worker caches explicitly by user request [#2028](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2028).\r\n- Optimise `latest by` on symbol column with no index, preventing in many cases a full table scan [#2010](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/2010).\r\n- Make `is null` an alias for `= null` and `is not null` for `!= null` for null comparisons. This is required to enable integration with 3rd parties, specifically [MindsDB](https://mindsdb.com/blog/tutorial-enabling-machine-learning-in-questdb-with-mindsdb/) [#1967](https://github.com/questdb/questdb/pull/1967).\r\n- Hide telemetry table from `tables()` SQL output.

O3 support adds flexibility and efficiency of use to the system and provides compatibility with the [Time Series Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/timescale/tsbs) (TSBS) which is used to reliably measure and compare the performance of time series databases. Also included with this version is a a massive internal revision of InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP) ingestion which brings significant performance improvements, alongside multiple UI fixes for the Web Console and SQL features.\r\n\r\n## What is new\r\n\r\n- **Arch:** ARM64 and Apple Silicon (M1) support (#878)\r\n- **O3** support for ingestion of records which are out-of-order (O3) by timestamp (#926)\r\n- **REST:** `fileName` parameter can be specified for the `/exp` endpoint for CSV exports (#830)\r\n- **PG wire:** PostgreSQL JDBC driver now supports `getSQLKeywords` method (#836)\r\n- **UI:** UI improvements for results with only one column (#897)\r\n- **UI:** Notification element does not obscure returned rows (#896)\r\n- **O3:** stable sort, reuse memory during sort (#987)\r\n- **O3:** move o3SortVarColumn0 to C++ (#984)\r\n\r\n## What we fixed\r\n\r\n- **PG wire:** fixed server \"hang\" when clients are slow to read data (#954)\r\n- **SQL:** implicit handling of scientific notation for floating-point literals (ex: .`12e-20`) (#957)\r\n- **SQL:** `LIMIT -1` returns last row as expected (#831)\r\n- **SQL:** Epoch timestamps supported in CSV imports (#876)\r\n- **SQL:** Behavior of `ORDER BY` query returns correct values on non-cached `symbol` types (#877)\r\n- **SQL:** Column names allow minus `-`  underscore `_` for compatibility with InfluxDB Line Protocol messages (#859)\r\n- **SQL:** latest by query could return data in incorrect timestamp order (#986)\r\n- **ILP:** logging of errno and replaced catch(CairoException) with catch(Throwable) (#983)\r\n- **O3:** fixed fairness issue in ILP (#981)\r\n\r\n## JDK versions for embedded applications\r\n\r\nUsers who wish to run QuestDB 6.0 in an embedded capacity in a Maven project may choose between JDK versions.\r\n\r\n**JDK11**\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>org.questdb</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>questdb</artifactId>\r\n            <version>6.0.0</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n```\r\n**JDK8**\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>org.questdb</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>questdb-jdk8</artifactId>\r\n            <version>6.0.0</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n```",

This is just the beginning. We are vectorising more operations. \r\n\r\nTry our first implementation in this release and stay tuned for more features in the upcoming releases!\r\n\r\n## IMPORTANT\r\nMetadata file format has been changed to include a new flag for columns of type symbol. It is necessary to convert existing tables to new format. Running the following sql: ```repair table myTable```, will update the table metadata.\r\n\r\n## What is new?\r\n\r\n- Java: vectorized sum(), avg(), min(), max() for DOUBLE, LONG, INT \r\n- Java: select distinct symbol optimisation\r\n- FreeBSD support\r\n- Automatically restore data consistency and recover from partial data loss.\r\n\r\n## What we fixed\r\n- SQL: NPE when parsing SQL text with malformed table name expression , for example ')', or ', blah'\r\n- SQL: parsing 'fill' clause in sub-query context was causing unexpected syntax error (#115)\r\n- SQL: possible internal error when ordering result of group-by or sample-by\r\n- Data Import: Ignore byte order marks (BOM) in table names created from an imported CSV (#114)\r\n- SQL: 'timestamp' propagation thru group-by code had issues. sum() was tripping over null values. Added last() aggregate function. (#113)\r\n- LOG: make service log names consistent on windows (#106)\r\n- SQL: deal with the following syntax 'select * from select ( select a from ....)'\r\n- SQL:  allow the following syntax 'case cast(x as int) when 1 then ...'\r\nfix(griffin): syntax check for \"case\"-')' overlap, e.g. \"a + (case when .. ) end\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It executes a little faster than generic algo.\r\n- GRIFFIN: `order by` implementation for cursors without random access to rows.\r\n- GRIFFIN: `group by` implementation\r\n- GRIFFIN: support multiple columns in `latest by` clause\r\n- GRIFFIN: renamed `to_char` for date and timestamp to `to_str` to make them easier to find\r\n- GRIFFIN: optimised `and` and `or` operators to recognise constant conditions better and avoid unnecessary data processing.\r\n- GRIFFIN: `=` implementation for SYMBOL = CHAR and STRING = CHAR\r\n- GRIFFIN: 'sum' performance optimisation\r\n- Network: ability to set multicast TTL and bind port for unicast\r\n- GRIFFIN: \"insert into ... values\" implementation\r\n- GRIFFIN: implementation of 'select count() from table' that would use result of base.size() when its available. This speed up exploratory 'count()' queries dramatically\r\n- GRIFFIN: UNION and UNION ALL implementations and tests\r\n- GRIFFIN: \"splice join\" implementation\r\n- GRIFFIN: alter table drop column SQL implementation\r\n- GRIFFIN: SQL `limit` implementation\r\n- GRIFFIN: `INNER`, `OUTER`, `AS OF` join implementation\r\n- CAIRO: \"remove partition\" API on TableWriter\r\n- CAIRO: new LONG256 data type\r\n\r\n- STD: ARM64 Linux support and binary\r\n- HTTP server implementation. The server is able to send and receive unlimited amount of data from and to data store.\r\n- STD: Os.currentTimeNanos() system clock in nanosecond resolution (not to be confused with System.nanoTime())\r\n- STD: (network) set/get TCP_NODELAY\r\n- STD: (network) implementation of interrupt for blocking accept()\r\n- STD: (network) bridge to native IP_MULTICAST_LOOP and IP_MULTICAST_IF\r\n- STD: (network) connect() and configureNoLinger() bridges\r\n- STD: (network) SO_REUSEADDR and SO_REUSEPORT bridges\r\n- STD: (log) implemented log writer that can roll files on size and/or date.\r\n- LineProtoSender can now be bound to a specific interface. It also receives IP addresses as inti n order to offload dealing with address parsing errors somewhere else.\r\n- STD: (threading) available() method is made available only on SP- and SC- sequences. available() is new to SPSequence and allows bulk publishing and enables higher queue throughput STD: Worker can have CPU affinity now\r\n\r\n## Whats changed?\r\n\r\n- new top level package name! This is a breaking change. We wanted to make package name consistent with our product web site.\r\n\r\n## What did we fix?\r\n\r\n- logging OS error code whenever close(fd) fails.\r\n- `null` for symbol value now corresponds to null for int. This removes unnecessary complexity around implementing getInt()\r\n- fixed transactional behaviour of TableWriter.truncate(). TableReader will now process this event correctly.\r\n- CAIRO: TableWriter maintains minTimestamp so that TableReader doesn't have to count directories to determine data interval\r\n- CAIRO: TableReader no longer relies on partition directories to be removed in order to remove logical data chunk. This is necessary for Windows where open files cannot be removed.\r\n- CAIRO: ByteSequence could allow reading beyond the size of the blob.\r\n- get/set lastModified on Windows could set incorrect time\r\n- fixed TextImportProcessor resume function\r\n- Files.exists() does not use Files.getLastModified() anymore\r\n- network send() and recv() on Linux did not handle errors correctly, which sometimes results in broken wire protocols.\r\n- Numbers.parseInt() could overflow without throwing exception\r\n- Removed garbage-generating lambdas.\r\n- CAIRO: SymbolTable reload could produce an exception",

    "text": "# Release QuestDB 3.0.0 (3.0.0)\n\nBeta release of new storage system dubbed CAIRO and new query system GRIFFIN.\r\n\r\n### CAIRO improves on now legacy system in several key areas:\r\n\r\n1. Performance. It is at least 30% faster in every test.\r\n2. Resilience. Cairo has been tested to withstand file system errors, such as corruption, space issue as well deal hardware stability issues, such as power loss or sudden reboots. Cairo will perform automatic data recovery in all of these circumstances\r\n3. Data management. Cairo implements functions of adding and removing table columns and partition management.\r\n4. Stability. Cairo is production ready. Data structures have been extensively tested to resolve all known defects.\r\n\r\nDownsides:\r\n\r\n1. Object store and retrieval is not implemented against CAIRO. The system focus is on zero-GC embedded storage.\r\n\r\n### GRIFFIN - SQL implementation that uses CAIRO as the store.\r\n\r\nThis system is under active development. For now lacks features of legacy SQL, such as joins, group-by and analytic functions - these are not yet developed. However GRIFFIN provides sample-by implementation with various missing data fill options, including linear interpolation and more extensive language basics, such as select from function. Eventually GRIFFIN will implement all features of legacy SQL and well beyond that.\r\n\r\nGRIFFIN also is not yet linked to HTTP server or any network service.\r\n\r\n",

    "text": "# Release 2.1.0 (THOR) (2.1.0)\n\n## New features\n\n### SSL encryption.\n\nReplication can be done over secure channel using industry-standard SSL encryption protocol. Configuring SSL is notoriously complicated, so I tried my best to make it as simple as possible for both `JournalServer` and `JournalClient`. I shall let you be the judge though. [More...](https://github.com/NFSdb/nfsdb/wiki/Replication-over-SSL)\n\n### SSL authentication.\n\nClient Certificate came almost for free after implementing SSL. I did try to make it simple for you though. [More...](https://github.com/NFSdb/nfsdb/wiki/Authentication#client-certificate-authentication)\n\n### Shared secret authentication.\n\nIt is now possible for client and server to exchange shared secret for authentication and authorization purposes. Shared Secret can be anything you want it to be, there is no limit on amount of data you can send. [More...](https://github.com/NFSdb/nfsdb/wiki/Authentication#shared-secret-authentication)\n\n### Kerberos authentication.\n\nUsually Kerberos is a pain, not with NFSdb, not anymore. Kerberos implementation uses Shared Secret exchange mechanism and in addition it handles generation and validation of `service tokens`, Your application deals with usernames. It is that cool! [More...](https://github.com/NFSdb/nfsdb/wiki/Authentication#kerberos-authentication)\n\n### Kerberos integrated Windows authentication.\n\nIf you have `JournalClient` running on Windows platform you can generate `service token` for currently logged in user with minimum fuss. User is not prompted for password! [More...](https://github.com/NFSdb/nfsdb/wiki/Authentication#kerberos-authentication)\n\n### JournalClient auto-reconnect\n\n`JournalClient` can automatically recover after server restarts. If you have multiple clients replicating single server you can restart server without needing to restart clients afterwards. Whats cooler still is that when you shutdown server clients can failover automatically. `JournalClient` will also maintain transactional consistency during server outages.\n\n## Compatibility warning\n\nReplication protocol is incompatible with previous release of NFSdb. I had to change the protocol to accomodate shared secret exchange.\n",
