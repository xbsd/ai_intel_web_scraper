The Q language, data serialization primitives, and IPC capabilities allow a skilled programmer to tailor-build  exactly the system you need  in one language, often in a codebase that would fit on a few sheets of paper instead of a few hundred or thousand.

It&#x27;s based on a language called Q and has been used at many banks to store exchange related data.\n\n---\n\n**fidotron**: This has come up before here, and the recent GNU APL stuff reminded me, but in summary, if you have ever been curious about APL or mildly suspicious of more conventional database approaches you owe it to yourself to take a look at the concepts at work here, especially primacy to columns instead of rows. The &amp; &quot;where&quot; operator in raw k has stayed with me over the years as a particularly inspired way to deal with column based data.\n\n---\n\n**tom_b**: Ck out Arthur Whitney&#x27;s abridged manual for fun:  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kx.com&#x2F;q&#x2F;d&#x2F;kdb+.htm  For using the 32-bit version (from Limits): 22 Limits Each database runs in memory and&#x2F;or disk map-on-demand -- possibly partitioned. There is no limit on the size of a partitioned database but on 32-bit systems the main memory OLTP portion of a database is limited to about 1GB of raw data, i.e. 1&#x2F;4 of the address space. The raw data of a main memory 64bit process should be limited to about 1&#x2F;2 of available RAM.\n\n---\n\n**jmnicolas**: Except financial applications what is it good for ?\n\n---\n\n**miecio13**: I&#x27;m not sure about the Q language, but their C API reads like obfuscated C contest entry:\n http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kx.com&#x2F;q&#x2F;c&#x2F;c&#x2F;k.h",

        "**gohwell**: For the unindoctrinated, KDB+ is an extremely fast, column oriented, in-memory database. It&#x27;s based on a language called Q and has been used at many banks to store exchange related data.",
        "**fidotron**: This has come up before here, and the recent GNU APL stuff reminded me, but in summary, if you have ever been curious about APL or mildly suspicious of more conventional database approaches you owe it to yourself to take a look at the concepts at work here, especially primacy to columns instead of rows. The &amp; &quot;where&quot; operator in raw k has stayed with me over the years as a particularly inspired way to deal with column based data.",
        "**tom_b**: Ck out Arthur Whitney&#x27;s abridged manual for fun:  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kx.com&#x2F;q&#x2F;d&#x2F;kdb+.htm  For using the 32-bit version (from Limits): 22 Limits Each database runs in memory and&#x2F;or disk map-on-demand -- possibly partitioned. There is no limit on the size of a partitioned database but on 32-bit systems the main memory OLTP portion of a database is limited to about 1GB of raw data, i.e. 1&#x2F;4 of the address space. The raw data of a main memory 64bit process should be limited to about 1&#x2F;2 of available RAM.",
        "**jmnicolas**: Except financial applications what is it good for ?",
        "**miecio13**: I&#x27;m not sure about the Q language, but their C API reads like obfuscated C contest entry:\n http:&#x2F;&#x2F;kx.com&#x2F;q&#x2F;c&#x2F;c&#x2F;k.h"

All of the above contribute to the failure modes when applying LLMs to the generation or &quot;understanding&quot; of source code in any programming language.\n\n---\n\n**sanjayjc**: &gt;  I think the aesthetic preference for terseness should give way to the preference for LLM accuracy, which may mean more verbose code  From what I understand, the terseness of array languages (Q builds on K) serves a practical purpose: all the code is visible at once, without the reader having to scroll or jump around. When reviewing an LLM&#x27;s output, this is a quality I&#x27;d appreciate.\n\n---\n\n**benjaminwootton**: The bigger issue is that LLMs haven’t had much training on Q as there’s little publically available code.  I recently had to try and hack some together and LLMs couldn’t string simple pieces of code together. It’s a bizarre language.\n\n---\n\n**neprotivo**: This approach of solving a problem by building a  low-perplexity path towards the solution reminds me of Grothendieck&#x27;s approach towards solving complex mathematical problems - you gradually build a theory which eventually makes the problem obvious.  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncatlab.org&#x2F;nlab&#x2F;show&#x2F;The+Rising+Sea\n\n---\n\n**Veedrac**: &gt; Let’s start with an example: (2#x)#1,x#0 is code from the official q phrasebook for constructing an x-by-x identity matrix. Is this... just to be clever? Why not       (!x)=&#x2F;:!x\n  \naka. the identity matrix is defined as having ones on the diagonal? Bonus points AI will understand the code better.",

When reviewing an LLM&#x27;s output, this is a quality I&#x27;d appreciate.",
        "**benjaminwootton**: The bigger issue is that LLMs haven’t had much training on Q as there’s little publically available code.  I recently had to try and hack some together and LLMs couldn’t string simple pieces of code together. It’s a bizarre language.",
        "**neprotivo**: This approach of solving a problem by building a  low-perplexity path towards the solution reminds me of Grothendieck&#x27;s approach towards solving complex mathematical problems - you gradually build a theory which eventually makes the problem obvious.  https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ncatlab.org&#x2F;nlab&#x2F;show&#x2F;The+Rising+Sea",
        "**Veedrac**: &gt; Let’s start with an example: (2#x)#1,x#0 is code from the official q phrasebook for constructing an x-by-x identity matrix. Is this... just to be clever? Why not       (!x)=&#x2F;:!x\n  \naka. the identity matrix is defined as having ones on the diagonal? Bonus points AI will understand the code better."

Just using UNIX domain socks is not the solution. This is more or less what dbus currently does and has major issues with memory accounting and trusts.\n\n---\n\n**sargun**: I&#x27;m kinda surprised that they don&#x27;t just build a service on top of generic netlink. For those of you who don&#x27;t know, Netlink has been a generic API for Kernel&lt;-&gt;Client communication for some time. The kernel added the ability for modules to register their own generic netlink families that can add another route of kinds for modules to communicate with. Does anyone know why?\n\n---\n\n**cgvgffyv**: Biased source. Selected post titles: - D-Bus, ConsoleKit, PolicyKit: turds upon turds upon turds - The Systemd (sic) debacle - D-Bus is completely unnecesary Choice quote: &quot;yes, they want me to call it “systemd”, but I’m averse, for some reason, to proper nouns beginning with lower-case letters; something to do with having had a moderately good education, I guess&quot; This is reddit-level drivel. Please refrain from posting it. An LWN article on bus1 will come out, eventually; post that instead.\n\n---\n\n**grabcocque**: This is basically just trolling. Poor show.\n\n---\n\n**fmap**: Judging by this description, Bus1 sounds very much like an object capability system. There is a lot of theoretical and practical evidence that this is a good programming model, and as far as I know it does not currently exist in linux. Maybe you can build a proper object capability system on top of sockets. I don&#x27;t know enough about unix domain sockets to say if it is really possible to establish the right security guarantees this way, but I&#x27;m reasonably sure that whoever is behind Bus1 has investigated this before proposing a new kernel extension. Case in point, the blog post describes a flawed implementation. What really rubs me the wrong way, though, is all the negativity expressed in this blog post. Also some of the suggestions are downright dangerous. For instance: &gt; (except that individual connections to a socket can be “revoked” i.e. closed, which is surely an improvement if anything) This is  not  an improvement, this is another failure state that you add to every single connection, and which every single client has to handle. You can already implement this feature via proxy objects in a pure object capability system, and in this case you have to be explicit about adding another error state. &gt; I think this is meant to read as “no, it’s not the D-Bus daemon functionality being subsumed in the kernel”. I read the preceeding explanation as saying &quot;here is a security guarantee that clients can rely on&quot;. What is the alternative? Having unix domain sockets sprinkled somewhere in the file system where everyone with the right permissions can access them? Great, now you have to write your nodes defensively again, to guard against file system priviledge escalation, or just badly administrated systems... The Bus1 documentation is describing a feature, and one which is (afaik) not present in Linux right now. &gt; Does global ordering of messages to different services ever actually matter? It certainly makes proofs easier, so my intuition is to say &quot;yes&quot;. Maybe the ordering doesn&#x27;t have to be globally consistent, but better safe than sorry.",

The kernel added the ability for modules to register their own generic netlink families that can add another route of kinds for modules to communicate with. Does anyone know why?",
        "**cgvgffyv**: Biased source. Selected post titles: - D-Bus, ConsoleKit, PolicyKit: turds upon turds upon turds - The Systemd (sic) debacle - D-Bus is completely unnecesary Choice quote: &quot;yes, they want me to call it “systemd”, but I’m averse, for some reason, to proper nouns beginning with lower-case letters; something to do with having had a moderately good education, I guess&quot; This is reddit-level drivel. Please refrain from posting it. An LWN article on bus1 will come out, eventually; post that instead.",
        "**grabcocque**: This is basically just trolling. Poor show.",
        "**fmap**: Judging by this description, Bus1 sounds very much like an object capability system. There is a lot of theoretical and practical evidence that this is a good programming model, and as far as I know it does not currently exist in linux. Maybe you can build a proper object capability system on top of sockets. I don&#x27;t know enough about unix domain sockets to say if it is really possible to establish the right security guarantees this way, but I&#x27;m reasonably sure that whoever is behind Bus1 has investigated this before proposing a new kernel extension. Case in point, the blog post describes a flawed implementation. What really rubs me the wrong way, though, is all the negativity expressed in this blog post. Also some of the suggestions are downright dangerous. For instance: &gt; (except that individual connections to a socket can be “revoked” i.e. closed, which is surely an improvement if anything) This is  not  an improvement, this is another failure state that you add to every single connection, and which every single client has to handle. You can already implement this feature via proxy objects in a pure object capability system, and in this case you have to be explicit about adding another error state. &gt; I think this is meant to read as “no, it’s not the D-Bus daemon functionality being subsumed in the kernel”. I read the preceeding explanation as saying &quot;here is a security guarantee that clients can rely on&quot;. What is the alternative? Having unix domain sockets sprinkled somewhere in the file system where everyone with the right permissions can access them? Great, now you have to write your nodes defensively again, to guard against file system priviledge escalation, or just badly administrated systems... The Bus1 documentation is describing a feature, and one which is (afaik) not present in Linux right now. &gt; Does global ordering of messages to different services ever actually matter? It certainly makes proofs easier, so my intuition is to say &quot;yes&quot;. Maybe the ordering doesn&#x27;t have to be globally consistent, but better safe than sorry."

I hope it gains some traction. Trying it out right now for small util my wife needs that has to run on a machine she doesn&#x27;t fully control.\n\n---\n\n**ForHackernews**: Obviously this has real advantages for making it easier for non-technical users to run Python applications, but I despair for the future of computing. A desktop computer in 2025 is going to have 47 redundant installations of Chromium for various electron apps, 78 separate-but-basically-identical Python runtimes as every small utility packages the entire Python interpreter + stdlib, 200,000 redundant npm packages...\n\n---\n\n**jchw**: Wow, very cool. This sounds like a lot of existing projects but done in a much cleaner fashion. If it was mentioned, I missed it, but I’m really curious to hear how things like cffi, etc. end up working. It may, with work, be possible to statically link CPython extensions, but cffi seems like a whole new packaging problem. To avoid the X-Y problem, I’ll state a high level goal. Let’s say I want to release an application using PyQt. Can PyOxidizer handle this in any way today? In the future, does PyOxidizer plan on handling any more of the problem? Since existing Python packaging infrastructure doesn’t attempt to answer problems like this, it’d be awesome to see new initiatives that do.\n\n---\n\n**mehrdadn**: Update 2: Gave up on MSYS2 and just used rustup. Managed to compile and run, but exit() doesn&#x27;t work. Also I just realized the executable contains the compilation path, which leaks private information? Makes it hard to compile and redistribute stuff, but otherwise I&#x27;d be very excited about the project. __________________________________________________ Update: Still can&#x27;t get it to work. Also, the tool seems to download random third-party packages that aren&#x27;t documented?     &gt; pyoxidizer run\n  no existing PyOxidizer artifacts found\n  processing config file pyoxidizer.toml\n  resolving Python distribution...\n  downloading https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;indygreg&#x2F;python-build-standalone&#x2F;releases&#x2F;download&#x2F;{...}&#x2F;cpython-{...}.tar.zst\n  ...\n  error[E0463]: can&#x27;t find crate for `std`\n    |\n    = note: the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` target may not be installed\n  \n  error: aborting due to previous error\n  \n  For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0463`.\n  error: Could not compile `rand_core`.\n  error: cargo build failed\n  \n__________________________________________________ I ran &#x27;cargo install pyoxidizer&#x27; and got     cargo install pyoxidizer\n      Updating registry `https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;crates.io-index`\n  error: failed to parse manifest at `%USERPROFILE%\\.cargo\\registry\\src\\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\\pyoxidizer-0.1.1\\Cargo.toml`\n  \n  Caused by:\n    editions are unstable\n  \n  Caused by:\n    feature `edition` is required\n  \n  this Cargo does not support nightly features, but if you switch to nightly channel you can add `cargo-features = [&quot;edition&quot;]` to enable this feature\n  \nNot sure where to go next...

        "**lawik**: Oooh, this seems like exactly what I need. I hope it gains some traction. Trying it out right now for small util my wife needs that has to run on a machine she doesn&#x27;t fully control.",
        "**ForHackernews**: Obviously this has real advantages for making it easier for non-technical users to run Python applications, but I despair for the future of computing. A desktop computer in 2025 is going to have 47 redundant installations of Chromium for various electron apps, 78 separate-but-basically-identical Python runtimes as every small utility packages the entire Python interpreter + stdlib, 200,000 redundant npm packages...",
        "**jchw**: Wow, very cool. This sounds like a lot of existing projects but done in a much cleaner fashion. If it was mentioned, I missed it, but I’m really curious to hear how things like cffi, etc. end up working. It may, with work, be possible to statically link CPython extensions, but cffi seems like a whole new packaging problem. To avoid the X-Y problem, I’ll state a high level goal. Let’s say I want to release an application using PyQt. Can PyOxidizer handle this in any way today? In the future, does PyOxidizer plan on handling any more of the problem? Since existing Python packaging infrastructure doesn’t attempt to answer problems like this, it’d be awesome to see new initiatives that do.",
        "**mehrdadn**: Update 2: Gave up on MSYS2 and just used rustup. Managed to compile and run, but exit() doesn&#x27;t work. Also I just realized the executable contains the compilation path, which leaks private information? Makes it hard to compile and redistribute stuff, but otherwise I&#x27;d be very excited about the project. __________________________________________________ Update: Still can&#x27;t get it to work. Also, the tool seems to download random third-party packages that aren&#x27;t documented?     &gt; pyoxidizer run\n  no existing PyOxidizer artifacts found\n  processing config file pyoxidizer.toml\n  resolving Python distribution...\n  downloading https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;indygreg&#x2F;python-build-standalone&#x2F;releases&#x2F;download&#x2F;{...}&#x2F;cpython-{...}.tar.zst\n  ...\n  error[E0463]: can&#x27;t find crate for `std`\n    |\n    = note: the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` target may not be installed\n  \n  error: aborting due to previous error\n  \n  For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0463`.\n  error: Could not compile `rand_core`.\n  error: cargo build failed\n  \n__________________________________________________ I ran &#x27;cargo install pyoxidizer&#x27; and got     cargo install pyoxidizer\n      Updating registry `https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;rust-lang&#x2F;crates.io-index`\n  error: failed to parse manifest at `%USERPROFILE%\\.cargo\\registry\\src\\github.com-1ecc6299db9ec823\\pyoxidizer-0.1.1\\Cargo.toml`\n  \n  Caused by:\n    editions are unstable\n  \n  Caused by:\n    feature `edition` is required\n  \n  this Cargo does not support nightly features, but if you switch to nightly channel you can add `cargo-features = [&quot;edition&quot;]` to enable this feature\n  \nNot sure where to go next...

I&#x27;m pleased to present PyKidos [1], a quick-and-dirty web application I built in a few days to teach my 8-year-old kid basic programming concepts using Python. I tried several existing apps but couldn&#x27;t find one that met all my criteria: - Fully browser-based, no need to install anything - Supports Python - Open-source and customizable - Simple UI&#x2F;UX - Includes simple graphical elements like a grid (my kid thought my plain IPython terminal was too &quot;boring&quot;) So I just built my own. PyKidos provides a playground where you can introduce various programming and math concepts to your child, such as: - Variables - Basic mathematical operations - Loops - Conditional statements - Modular arithmetic - Vectors - Functions - Coordinate systems - Color systems - Trigonometric functions - Matrices - And more. Features: - Completely client-side: data is stored only in your browser (localStorage). - Utilizes Pyodide [2], a CPython port to WebAssembly, with support for NumPy and other scientific libraries. - Includes a Unicode emoji picker and color picker. - Allows manipulation of a grid (cell colors and text, including Unicode emojis) using Python. - Reacts to click and keyboard events within the grid. - Supports animations. - Enables local download of your Python scripts. - Facilitates code sharing through a URL containing the entire code and data. PyKidos is still quite rough around the edges since I primarily built it for my own needs, but I hope it proves helpful to others. In particular, I didn&#x27;t take the time to ensure it runs smoothly on mobile devices, different browsers, or operating systems. Feel free to report issues, ask questions, offer suggestions, or submit pull requests.

Will try it with my kids later :) If you’re interested in teaching kids Python, also take a look at Hedy. It’s a gradual language that exposed more programming paradigms with each level.
