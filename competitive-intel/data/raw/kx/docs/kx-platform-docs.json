    "text": "\n# KX Delta Platform\n\nKX Delta Platform\nis a framework that allows you to design, build and deploy high-performance,  enterprise-grade, data-capture systems. It brings together hundreds of man-years of experience in creating enterprise-grade data capture, analysis and visualization systems. Built on top of kdb+, the worldâs leading column-oriented database,\nKX Delta Platform\nallows you to capture, store, and analyze real-time and historical data.\nSystems built using\nKX Delta Platform\nhandle massive volumes and velocities of data using high-performance, in-memory and on-disk historical databases. These systems feature extensive redundancy, fault tolerance, query filtering, alerting, reporting and visualization capabilities and are used for stock market analysis, algorithmic trading, predictive analytics, scientific analysis, and embedded-sensor data capture.\nKX Control\nis a client-server application that allows you to design, build, deploy and manage data-capture/streaming systems:\n- Capture, store, and analyze real-time and historical data using kdb+\n- Supports high-performance and real-time to handle massive volumes and velocities of data\n- Supports in-memory and historical databases\n- Enterprise-grade redundancy, load balancing, fault tolerance via multi-process architecture and software\n- Enterprise-grade data recovery and data audit control via multi-process architecture, logs, and software\n- Enterprise-grade security via entitlement-permissioning system\n- Built-in querying, filtering, alerting, monitoring, reporting and visualization capabilities\n- Flexible configuration capabilities via packages, parameters, and grouping\n- Complete shared-development environment (code repository, package repository, version control, editor, debugger, TDD testing, etc.)\n- Libraries for streaming systems (e.g.KX Stream)\n- Libraries for a variety of financial and non-financial applications (KX for Surveillance,KX for Flow)\n\n## Generic applications\n\n- Real-time tick capture and storage\n- Real-time and historical querying, filtering, analysis\n- Business visualisation of underlying data\n- Real-time signal generation and data enrichment\n- Signal processing and execution\n\n## Specific applications\n\n- Trade and price analysis\n- Modelling and back testing\n- Price aggregation and distribution\n- Order execution\n- Algo trading\n- Market surveillance\n- Risk analysis and aggregation\n\n## Key concepts\n\nHere are some key practices\nKX Control\nsupports when developing your system:\n- Useenvironmental parametersthroughout the system to make it easier to move the system from one machine to another, for example, parameters for file paths and IP addresses. These parameters are loaded into the systemâs configuration profile at start-up.\n- Build systems withfull version controland maintainaudit logsindefinitely. Define checkpoints during development to exploit the version-control system. All entities can be reverted to previous versions and the system as a whole can be reverted to a defined checkpoint.\n- Give every entity within the systemsecurity entitlements. Entitlements enforce security constraints and provide different views of the system to different users.\n- Group entitiesin the system into containers and manage them at the group level.\n- Employ amulti-process architecture. Write each component to ensure that it can restart upon failure. Recovery is possible from a combination of RDB, HDB and Tickerplant log files. In any system, keep the number of critical processes to a minimum. All entities contain descriptive fields which should be populated as the system is developed.\n\n## Typical data-capture system example\n\nThis diagram is a simplified view of a data-capture system.\nThe system consists of a set of processes. Each process plays a specific role in the processing of capturing data. All of the processes in the system can be replicated for scalability, resilience and fault tolerance. In addition, each process can be augmented with a variety of attributes to handle data definition, security, exception conditions, configuration flexibility, etc.\n\n## Architecture\n\nServerTheKX Controlserver is responsible for the administration of your system. It offers a single point of access for building, running and managing systems deployed across multiple machines. It also provides run-time management, such as monitoring running processes, restarting processes, alerting if a process fails, and deploying code changes to live environments. The server provides a centralized code-development repository with versioning and rollback support. It also provides a package-management mechanism for importing and exporting code changes across multiple environments.HTML5 clientThe HTML5 client is the main method of interaction with theKX Controlserver. All aspects of your system can be viewed, modified and controlled from here. Each user gets a different view of your system, depending on what they are allowed to view and modify. The client has a built-in IDE for code development.\nPicture needs updated in line with rebranding (Control for KX to become KX Control)\n\n## Readers\n\nThis documentation is written for developers using\nKX Control\nto build systems based on KX technology.\nUsers\nrefers to developers, and\nadmins\nto developers with administrative privileges in\nKX Control\n.\nThe system\nand\nyour system\nrefer to the system you build, not to\nKX Control\n.",
