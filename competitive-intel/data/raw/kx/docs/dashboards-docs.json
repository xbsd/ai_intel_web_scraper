    "title": "Manage Actions",
    "text": "\n# Manage Actions\n\nThis page describes Actions which are a common property set used to configure a\nview state\n, run a\nquery\nor open an URL.\nThis section provides information on:\nno toc\n- Add an Action\n- Action Types\n- Component-specific actions\n- Action execution\n\n## Add an Action\n\nTo add an action, click\nin one of the following components which support Actions.\n- Data Grid\n- Pivot Grid\n- ChartGL\n- Pie Chart\n- Radar Chart\n- Canvas Chart\n- Data Form\n- Form Builder\n- Drop Down List\n- Button\n- Text Input\n- Selection Controls\n- Date Picker\n- Date Range Picker\n- Tree View\n- Upload\n- Map\n- Map (External APIs)\n- Treemap\n- Graph\n- Bipartite Chart\n- Navigation Menu\n\n## Action Types\n\nThe following types of actions are supported:\nno toc\n- View State Mapping\n- Open Dashboard/Screen\n- Run Query\n- Open URL\n- Apply Rolling Syntax/View State Default\nAdditional\ncomponent-specific actions\nare available for each of the components that support Actions.\nSee\nhere\nfor details on the order of execution of actions.\n\n### View State Mapping\n\nThe\nView State Mapping\naction maps values of\nView State parameters\nfrom the source dashboard to View State parameters in the destination Dashboard.\nSupported view state mapping actions include:\n\n| Action | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 | Map value of view state A to view state B in the current dashboard |\n| 2 | Map value of view state A to view state B in the target dashboard, where \"B\" is the name of the view state in the destination dashboard (case sensitive) |\n| 3 | Map the literal string 'A' to view state B in the current dashboard |\n| 4 | Map the literal string 'A' to view state B in the target dashboard, where \"B\" is the name of the view state in the destination dashboard (case sensitive) |\n\nTip\nBefore mapping View State parameters across dashboards, create the target View State Parameter in the destination dashboard. View state Mapping can map only to existing View State Parameters; mapping actions does not create them.\n\n### Open dashboard/screen\n\nThe\nOpen dashboard/screen\naction lets you specify a dashboard and screen to open on button click.\nDashboard names can be assigned to a viewstate. If assigned to a text variable, for example of type String, then it navigates to the dashboard with that name.\nDashboard and screen reference can also be set using view states\n\n### Run Query\n\nThe\nRun Query\naction means the linked query is executed on click.\n.\nSet the following property:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Data Source | Select thedata sourceto run on action click. |\n| Run Actions Asynchronously | Refer toAction executionfor details. |\n\n\n### Open URL\n\nThe\nOpen URL\naction means a click redirects to a new web page.\nSet the following properties:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Url | The destination site. |\n| Target | Open in current tab,This Windowor new tab,New Window. |\n\n\n### Apply Rolling Syntax/View State Default\n\nIf a view state has\nrolling syntax\n, this action updates the view states's value using the rolling syntax. Otherwise, it updates the view state's value with the value specified in the view state's\nDefault\nattribute.\nSet the following property:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| View State | The View State containing the rolling syntax. |\n\nFor example:\n- Create a view state calledtomorrowwith rolling syntax set toNOW+24:00\n- Add a Date Picker component to a Dashboard and set itsSelected Dateto the tomorrow view state. This shows the current value of the view state and allows you to change it.\n- Add a Button component to a dashboard and add an Action so that the tomorrow view state is updated using the rolling syntax every time the button is clicked.\n- Switch toPreviewmode and click the Button. Every time the button is clicked it either applies the rolling syntax to the view state's value or it resets the value of the view state using its default value when there is no rolling syntax.\n\n## Component configuration\n\nThe following sections describe component specific actions for:\n- Canvas Chart\n- Data Grid\n- Pivot Grid\n- Navigation\n- Pie Chart\n- Upload\n\n### Canvas Chart\n\nCanvas chart actions include\nTrigger Action\nand\nSource Column.\nSet the following properties:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Trigger Action | Select eitherClickorHoveras the event to trigger the action. |\n| Source Column | For View State Mapping, determine which value is mapped; either,** or from thedata source. |\n| Run Actions Asynchronously | Refer toAction executionfor details. |\n\n\n### Data Grid\n\nActions for data grid include\nTrigger Column\nand\nTrigger Action\n.\nSet the following properties:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Trigger Column | Column on whichTrigger Actionexecutes the action |\n| Trigger Action | Select one of the following as the event to trigger the action;mouse in,mouse out,click,double-click,right-clickorhover. |\n| Source Column | For View State Mapping, determine which value is mapped; either,,**or from thedata source. |\n| Run Actions Asynchronously | Refer toAction executionfor details. |\n\n\n### Pivot Grid\n\nActions for pivot grid include\nTrigger Action\nand\nSource Column\n.\nSet the following properties:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Trigger Action | Specifies the event associated with the Action. The supported events are:Click,Double Click,Right- ClickorHover. |\n| Source Column | For View State Mapping, this setting specifies where the value to be mapped into a view state comes from. Options include the identified column or{breakdownId}(from left to right, value from the last visible breakdown column). |\n| Run Actions Asynchronously | Refer toAction executionfor details. |\n\n\n### Navigation\n\nOnly\nview state mapping\nis tied to Actions; opening dashboards and URLs is done by\nbuttons\n.\n\n### Pie Chart\n\nSet the following properties:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Source | For View State Mapping, determine which value is mapped from thedata source. |\n| Run Actions Asynchronously | Refer toAction executionfor details. |\n| Viewstate |  |\n\n\n### Upload\n\nSet the following properties:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Trigger Action | Select the event to trigger the action. The options areClick,Double-click. |\n| Trigger Source |  |\n| Run Actions Asynchronously | Refer toAction executionfor details. |\n\n\n## Action execution\n\nThe\nRun Actions Asynchronously\nproperty controls whether actions are executed in parallel or sequentially. Use this toggle to\nenable\nor\ndisable\nasynchronous execution.\nWhen this is\nenabled, it improves performance and flexibility by separating actions into two execution groups:\nAsynchronous\n- Any actions marked to run asynchronously are grouped together.\n- These actions are executed asynchronously, in the order they appear in the action list.\n- This is useful for non-blocking operations like API calls, UI updates, or delayed animations.\n- There is a maximum of 10 seconds allowed for each action before the next action is called .\nSynchronous\n- All other actions (not marked asynchronous) continue to run synchronously, one after the other, before or after the asynchronous group (depending on their position in the list).\n- These actions are blocking â meaning each one finishes before the next starts\nWhen\ndisabled (the default setting), actions are run in their listed order with the exception of Navigation actions which are executed last irrespective of their position in the sequence. If there is more than one navigation action, then only the last of those navigation actions is executed.\nWhile actions are run in order, each action does not require the prior one to finish before starting the next action.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- Configure data source connections\n- Explore components",

To add components, simply click-and-drag the component you want into the workspace. The screenshot below exemplifies adding the\nData Grid\ncomponent.\nRefer to\nComponents\nfor details of all the components you can add to your dashboards.\n\n## Central canvas\n\nThis is where you arrange and resize components by dragging the resizing handles on the edges.\n\n## Component properties\n\nThis is where you can customize the components added in the central canvas. Selecting a dashboard component displays its properties on the right side, as shown below.\nProperties are different for each component, but almost all have a\nData Source\nproperty.\n\n## Dashboard properties\n\nAt the top of the Properties Panel, there are icons for quick access to online help,\ndata sources\n,\nview states\nand the\nDocument Graph\nfeature.\n\n| icon | description |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | Opens a new browser tab for context-sensitive help and documentation. |\n|  | Opens theData Dialog. |\n|  | Opens theView State Dialog. |\n|  | Displays theDocument Graph. |\n\n\n### Property Search\n\nSearch for a property within a selected component.\nThe Dashboard properties are shown in the screenshot below, and described in the following sections.\n\n### Basics\n\nThese are the basic properties you can configure for your dashboards. See the table below for more information.\n\n| property | description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Hash | This is the hash used in the dashboard URL.To change the URL hash:1. Update the hash in the property editor.2. Click on the dashboard save button.This reloads the page with the new hash in the dashboard URL. |\n| Name | A name for the dashboard. |\n| Link | This represents the URL generated after creating your dashboard. This URL is automatically generated and cannot be edited, ensuring that it remains consistent and secure. It is designed for easy sharing with users who need to view the dashboardâs content. When clicked, it opens the dashboard in a new browser tab, allowing users to interact with the data and visualizations. |\n| Hostname(s) access | Restrict access to the dashboard to the specified hostname. Multiple hostnames can be added by separating with a comma. If blank, then all hostnames have access to the dashboard. |\n| Enable \"Share Dashboard\" | Adds a share icon to generate a link which stores the viewed states (e.g. pivot drill down position) which can be shared with others. |\n| Save Viewer State | Defines how view states are used.It includes the following options.view statedescriptionEnabledWhen a user saves their dashboard, the current value of any view states in the dashboard are saved and used the next time the dashboard is loaded.DisabledUser defined view state values are not stored on dashboard save. Each load of a dashboard is treated as a new instance with respect to view states; default values are used.Enabled (Autosave)Changes in view state values are automatically saved on change. Values are stored and used the next time the dashboard is loaded. | view state | description | Enabled | When a user saves their dashboard, the current value of any view states in the dashboard are saved and used the next time the dashboard is loaded. | Disabled | User defined view state values are not stored on dashboard save. Each load of a dashboard is treated as a new instance with respect to view states; default values are used. | Enabled (Autosave) | Changes in view state values are automatically saved on change. Values are stored and used the next time the dashboard is loaded. |\n| view state | description |\n| Enabled | When a user saves their dashboard, the current value of any view states in the dashboard are saved and used the next time the dashboard is loaded. |\n| Disabled | User defined view state values are not stored on dashboard save. Each load of a dashboard is treated as a new instance with respect to view states; default values are used. |\n| Enabled (Autosave) | Changes in view state values are automatically saved on change. Values are stored and used the next time the dashboard is loaded. |\n| Unsaved Viewer Prompt | When checked, the user is prompted about unsaved changes before switching to another dashboard. |\n| Fill Height | When checked, the dashboard fills the height of the browser.KX Dashboardsalways fill the  browser width.Note: IfFill Heightis disabled,Row CountbecomesRow Height;Row Heightis the height, in pixels, between each grid row. The number of grid rows used is defined by the priorRow Countvalue; e.g. ifRow Countis 30 andRow Heightis set to 30; then the distance from top to bottom - in the absence ofFill Heightis 900 pixels. If the pixel height is greater than the browser height, a scroll bar appears. In addition, some components may be positioned off-screen. |\n| Floatable | When enabled, an added component snaps to nearest row anchor. Otherwise, component always snaps to top row. |\n| Column Count / Row Count / Row Height | Define Layout grid size. Components added are locked in position to this grid. The grid is visible when a component is dragged into position. |\n\nFor more details on these options, see the\nLayout Panel\n.\nTip\nTo prevent loss of work from server time outs, save your dashboard on a regular basis.\n\n### Style\n\nDefine the following style properties for your dashboard.\n\n| property | description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Main Menu Button | This setting determines the visibility of the Main Menu button for all Dashboard modes (Design,Preview,End User).Select from the following options:Show- Shows the Main Menu buttonHide- Hides the Main Menu buttonHide (End User only)- Hides the Main Menu button for the End User version of the DashboardNoteWhen using a Dashboard that was created with versions earlier than KX Dashboards 2.16, the default value isHide (End User only). Otherwise, the default value isShow. |\n| Dashboard Theme / Theme Switchable | Sets Light or Dark theme for dashboard and defines if theme can be switched. This should be disabled (theme-locked) if the dashboard uses custom styling which would not update on global theme switch. |\n| Widgets Spacing / Widget Shadow | Define the distance in pixels between components and add optional shadow. |\n| Background Color / Transparent Background | Define the background color of the components. |\n| Border Size / Border Color / Border Rounding / Border Spacing | Define border criteria of components. |\n| Show Loading Indicators | When checked, indicates when dashboard is loading data. If your dashboard uses streaming, managed or polling data, leave this unchecked. |\n\nSee\nStyle\nfor common style properties.\n\n### Hierarchical Rules\n\nHierarchical rules enable you to define styling and behavior at the Dashboard level, eliminating the need to configure rules separately for each component. This approach simplifies management and ensures consistent, dynamic behavior across all widgets. Refer to\nManage Hierarchical Rules\nfor further details and an example.\nThere are three types of\nHierarchical Rules\n, described below. The properties displayed vary depending on the rule you select.\n- Rules are evaluated at render-time.\n- If multiple rules apply to a layer, the last one is applied.\nNote\nA component can override these hierarchical rules using their override rules. See\nChartGL Override Rules\nfor details.\nColumn Color\nLayer Color Palette\nAxis Formatting\nThe\nColumn Color\nrule targets a specified column, and applies a specified color to the column if the rule matches the specified text string or regex pattern. Rule properties are defined in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rule Name | Enter a name for the rule. |\n| Rule Target (Column Name) | Select the column that the rule targets, or enter a regular expression or wildcard in the data entry field, then clickAdd Custom Column.In the example above, the regex/Weight/is used to match the stringWeight. If the target column contains this string theRule Coloris applied. |\n| Use Color Palette | When unchecked, you can define a single color for the rule. SeeSeeRule Color.When checked, a color palette selector is displayed instead of the single color picker. Optionally, select a Palette Theme.For any rule that appears multiple times in the chart, each instance is assigned a color from the selected palette.Palette colors are used in order of occurrence: first match gets color 1, second match gets color 2, and so on.If there are more occurrences than colors in the palette, the palette loops. |\n| Rule Color | The color to be applied to the matching column whenUse Color Paletteis unchecked. |\n\nThe\nLayer Color Palette\nrule targets a specified layer, and applies a specified color palette to the layer if the rule matches the specified text string or regex pattern. The rule properties are defined in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rule Name | Enter a name for the rule. |\n| Rule Target (Layer Name) | Select the layer that the rule targets, or enter a regular expression or wildcard in the data entry field, then clickAdd Custom Layer.In the example above, the regex/Layer/is used to match the Layer to which the Palette Theme is applied. |\n| Palette Theme | Optionally, select the palette theme to apply to the matching layer. |\n\nThe\nAxis Formatting\nrule targets a specified axis property (prefix, suffix, or decimal places) and applies a specific string to the matching axis if the rule matches the specified text string or regex pattern. The rule properties are defined in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rule Name | Enter a name for the rule. |\n| Rule Target (Axis) | Select the axis that the rule targets, or enter a regular expression or wildcard in the data entry field, then clickAdd Custom Axis.In the example above the regexX-Axisis used to match the axis to which the prefix is applied. |\n| Axis Property | The axis property that the rule targets. This can be set to:Prefix,SuffixorDecimal Places. |\n| Rule Condition | Click to specify the rule condition. Select a column or enter a regex or wildcard in the data entry field and clickAdd Custom Column.The rule is only applied to the axis if the axis is linked to a layer containing a column matching or containing this string.In the example above, the regex/Eur/is specified, meaning it checks for layers that have columns containing the stringEur. |\n| Rule Action | Apply a specific string to the matching axis.In the example aboveâ¬is applied as a prefix to the axis labels when theY-Axisis linked to a layer that  has a column containing the stringEur. |\n\n\n### Popups\n\nPopups are interactive elements that appear on top of the main content to provide additional information.\nCreate a popup then edit to add content into the popup element.\nThe table below describes the elements you can set for a Popup.\n\n| property | description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Name | Use this field to provide a name for the popup. |\n| Visible | Assign a boolean viewstate. The viewstate can be triggered by anAction. If no view state is assigned and the box is checked, the popup appears when the dashboard loads. |\n| Dialog Title | This is the header name of the popup. |\n| Dialog Height / Dialog Width | Dimension area of the popup in pixels. |\n| Modal | Check this box to make the popup modal. |\n| Dialog Top / Dialog Left | The position of the popup is measured in pixels from top and/or left of screen.  If this is not set, the popup appears in the middle of the screen. |\n| Resizable | If this is checked, it allows you to resize the popup window. |\n\n\n#### Actions on Close\n\nA series of\nview state parameters\nvalues can be mapped when the popup dialog is closed.\nNavigate to\nActions\nfor further details.\n\n### Notifications\n\nThis is where you can customize the properties shown in the following screenshot for the notifications, as described in the table below.\n\n| property | description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Enabled | When this is checked, it enables the notification messages. For example, in case of a failed login attempt, a notification is displayed on the screen. |\n| In Browser | When enabled, the notifications are forced to display in the browser, in a location set byPosition, below Native notifications trigger when this is disabled. |\n| Position | Sets the location of then notification message. You can choose fromTop Left,Top Center,Top Right,Center Left,Center Right,Bottom Left,Bottom Center,Bottom Right. |\n| Max Count | Maximum number of messages displayed at any one time. |\n| FadeOut (s) | This sets how long the notification remains on screen. The time is expressed in seconds. |\n| Icon | Select frombell-o,flag-o,bullhorn,clock-o,comment-o,commenting-o,exclamation-circle,exclamation-triangle,noneif an icon is required as part of the notification. |\n| Sound | Select frombeep,beepbeep,noneif an sound notification is required. |\n| Group Notification | This is a checkbox that enables or disables grouping for notifications. |\n| Grouping | EnableGroup Notificationsfor notifications to be grouped as a single message within an interval defined in seconds underGrouping Interval. |\n| Grouping Interval | Set the interval in seconds for the grouped notifications. |\n\n\n#### Set Trigger\n\nThis property allows you to define specific conditions under which notifications are sent. Essentially, it enables you to set conditions for your data so when the data meets or exceeds these conditions, an alert is triggered. The following screenshot shows the trigger properties you can set, as described in the table below.\n.\n\n| property | description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Datasource | Defines the conditions for the trigger. The data source has to use streaming, managed or polling data.

    "text": "\n# Manage View States\n\nThis section describes view states which are used to store values accessible to all components of the dashboard. They can be used to pass values like user selections or preferences between components and into\nqueries\n.\nThis section provides information on:\n- The View State dialog\n- Creating View States\n- Rolling View States\n- View States in Query Editor\n- View State routing\n- Linking components using View States\n- System View States\n- Cleaning up View States\n- View State Persistence\n\n## View State Dialog\n\nThe View State dialog is used to create and manage view states. The following screenshot shows a\nView State\ndialog with a selected view state, its properties, and a graphical representation of its relationship to data sources and components.\nTo open the\nView State\ndialog, use one of the following methods:\n- Click on the eye iconat the top of the Properties Panel.\n- Click inside any input box showing the eye icon.\nTip\nSome inputs offer View States, but the icon is hidden. For some itâs to the left of the\nClear button. If a View State is available, a rollover of the input displays the eye icon.\nWith a View State paired to a\nText Input\nor\nDrop Down\ncomponent, a userâs input can be passed to any dashboard component.\nTip\nTo prevent errors, it may be necessary to include a text prompt to help the user to put information in the correct form.\n\n## View State dialog layout\n\nAt the top of the dialog are buttons to create, edit, and delete or\nclean up\nview states that are not used.\nThe body of the dialog consists of 3 main sections:\n- a list of view states and folders on the left\n- aPropertiespanel which is used to specify the type and values for the selected view state\n- a view stateGraphwhich depicts the selected view state and all data sources or components that reference the selected view state. Each component in the graph is named, as described in thenext section.\n\n### Component Names in the View State Graph\n\nEach Dashboard component is given an internal name by default, which is displayed in the view state graph, shown here.\nAny component in your Dashboard can be given a user-defined name by assigning a value to its Name property, shown here.\nIf present, the view state graph displays the user-defined name instead of its internal name, shown here.\nTip\nAssigning a user-defined name to a component can help identify components in the view state graph.\n\n## Create a View State\n\n- In the Select View State dialog, clickNewto create a new View State.\n- Enter aNamefor the new parameter.\n- Set the field values described in the following tables.Field nameDescriptionTypeChoose from one of the options in theTypedrop-down list:boolean,byte,char,date,datetime,dict,double,float,guid,int,list,long,minute,month,second,short,string,symbol,time,timespan,timestampRollingTheRollingcheckbox is displayed when theTypeis set to one of the following; date, datetime, minute, month, second, time, timestamp. SeeRollingfor details.DefaultYou have the option to enter a default value for the new view state. Components and queries referencing this view state use the default value in the following situations:The Reset View State button in the toolbaris clicked.The Dashboard is loaded, has not been previously saved by the user, and the view state value has not been passed to the Dashboard (that isEnable \"Share Dashboard\"has not been ticked in the Basics properties).The Dashboard is loaded with theSave Viewer State] property disabled, the Dashboard has not been previously saved by the user, and the view state value has not been passed to the Dashboard (that is, whenSharing View States acrossKX Dashboardswith a button).ValueThis represents the current value of the view state. If a component is using a view state, and the user changes the value, theValueattribute of that view state is updated to that value.\n- ClickSelect Item.\n\n## Rolling\n\nThe Rolling feature allows you to specify a default value that is dynamic. This feature uses syntax that is evaluated in the following situations:\n- In the same circumstances as for a view state'sDefaultfield, as described in theprevious section.\n- When aKX Dashboardscomponent refers to it as anAction.\n- When adata sourceparameter is configured to use the rolling syntax from a view state.\nTo create a Rolling view state:\n- Create a new view state as describedabove.\n- Choose one of the following data types from theTypedrop-down list:date,datetime,minute,month,second,time,timestamp.For each of these types, a checkbox labelledRollingis visible above theDefaultfield.\n- CheckRollingto enable theDefaultfield for data entry.\n- In theDefaultfield, enter a value using the appropriaterolling syntax.For example, usingNOW+24:00causes the view state's value to be set to tomorrow's date and time whenever a default value is needed for this view state.Notice that when you set this value as theDefaultit automatically updates theValuefield.\n- ClickClose.\n\n### Persistent state for rolling view states\n\nYou can remove rolling syntax from a View State by unchecking\nRolling\nabove the\nDefault\nfield in a View State parameter.\nHowever it is not possible to remove the rolling syntax from a view state if it is in use by a\ndata source\ncommitted to the Dashboard. This does not mean the Dashboard has to be saved, but it does mean the data source has to be applied to the Dashboard.\nTherefore, when the rolling syntax of a view state is being used by a  data source, the\nRolling\ncheckbox is disabled in the view state dialog.\nThe following screenshot shows a view state with Rolling deactivated, because the view state is being used by a data source.\nWhen the rolling syntax of a view state is being used by a data source, only data types that support rolling syntax can be selected in the View States dialog, as illustrated below.\n\n### Rolling Syntax\n\nThe following table describes the valid syntax for\nRolling\nview states.\n\n| Syntax | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| NOW | Refers to the current moment in time and can be used alone or as part of an expression.\n        NOW can be immediately followed by an operator (+ or -) and an operand. |\n| NOW+xNOW-x | xrefers to a number that is provided by the user who is authoring the rolling syntax. The value ofxis a multiple of a duration based on the data type.\n        The table below shows the duration associated withxfor each data type:Data TypeDurationsecondsecondsminute, timeminutesdate, datetime, timestampdaysmonthmonthsThe operator (+, -) is used to add or subtract a duration as part of the expression. For example:Data TypeExpressionResultsecondNOW+10Adds 10 seconds to NOWtimeNOW+30Adds 30 minutes to NOWdateNOW-5Subtracts 5 days from NOWmonthNOW-10Subtracts 10 months from NOWFor the datetime and timestamp data types, using NOW+x or NOW-x the time value is set to 00:00:00.\n        To advance or reverse while retaining the current time, use the time format with multiples of 24 hours (that is NOW+24:00, NOW+48:00). | Data Type | Duration | second | seconds | minute, time | minutes | date, datetime, timestamp | days | month | months | Data Type | Expression | Result | second | NOW+10 | Adds 10 seconds to NOW | time | NOW+30 | Adds 30 minutes to NOW | date | NOW-5 | Subtracts 5 days from NOW | month | NOW-10 | Subtracts 10 months from NOW |\n| Data Type | Duration |\n| second | seconds |\n| minute, time | minutes |\n| date, datetime, timestamp | days |\n| month | months |\n| Data Type | Expression | Result |\n| second | NOW+10 | Adds 10 seconds to NOW |\n| time | NOW+30 | Adds 30 minutes to NOW |\n| date | NOW-5 | Subtracts 5 days from NOW |\n| month | NOW-10 | Subtracts 10 months from NOW |\n| NOW+hh:mm:ss.sssNOW-hh:mm:ss.sss | NOW+hh:mm:ss.sssadds the specified time duration to the value of NOW.NOW-hh:mm:ss.ssssubtracts the specified time duration from the value of NOW. \n         When specifying a time formatted value, the number of hours can exceed 24. For example:ExpressionResultNOW+00:30Adds 30 minutes to NOWNOW-48:00Subtracts 48 hours from NOWNOW+1:30:10Adds 1 hour, 30 minutes and 10 seconds to NOWWhen using the month data type, it is possible for the NOW+hh:mm:ss.sss expression to result in a different month. | Expression | Result | NOW+00:30 | Adds 30 minutes to NOW | NOW-48:00 | Subtracts 48 hours from NOW | NOW+1:30:10 | Adds 1 hour, 30 minutes and 10 seconds to NOW |\n| Expression | Result |\n| NOW+00:30 | Adds 30 minutes to NOW |\n| NOW-48:00 | Subtracts 48 hours from NOW |\n| NOW+1:30:10 | Adds 1 hour, 30 minutes and 10 seconds to NOW |\n| NOW+x@hh:mm:ss.sssNOW-x@hh:mm:ss.sss | NOW+x@hh:mm:ss.sss adds a specified number of days (x) to NOW, and sets the time to the value specified after the@sign.\n        NOW-x@hh:mm:ss.sss subtracts a specified number of days (x) from NOW, and sets the time to the value specified after the@sign.\n        These expressions work with the datetime and timestamp data types. For example:ExpressionResultNOW+1@12:00Adds 1 day to NOW and the time value is 12:00NOW-1@23:59:59Subtracts 1 day from NOW and the time value is 23:59:59The rolling syntax expression is expected to have no spaces.\n        If theRollingcheckbox is checked and no rolling syntax is provided, the keyword NOW is used.\n     The use of theTkeyword remains functional. However, it is recommended that the NOW keyword be used instead because theTkeyword is deprecated. | Expression | Result | NOW+1@12:00 | Adds 1 day to NOW and the time value is 12:00 | NOW-1@23:59:59 | Subtracts 1 day from NOW and the time value is 23:59:59 |\n| Expression | Result |\n| NOW+1@12:00 | Adds 1 day to NOW and the time value is 12:00 |\n| NOW-1@23:59:59 | Subtracts 1 day from NOW and the time value is 23:59:59 |\n| Weekdays (WD) | Seehere for details on weekdays syntax. |\n| Business days (BD) | Seehere for details on business days syntax. |\n\n\n#### Weekdays\n\nA weekday is defined as any day within the week except Saturday and Sunday. The rolling feature allows you to specify what type of day to consider by using the keyword\nWD\n. When\nWD\nis present, only weekdays are used to determine the calendar day.\nWD\ncan be used with the following data types:\ndate\n,\ndatetime\n,\ntimestamp\nWeekday syntax includes:\n\n| Syntax | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| NOW+xWD | Adds a specified number of weekdays (x) to NOW. |\n| NOW-xWD | Subtracts a specified number of weekdays (x) from NOW. |\n| NOW+xWD@hh:mm:ss.sss | Adds a specified number of weekdays (x) to NOW, and sets the time to the value specified after the@sign. |\n| NOW-xWD@hh:mm:ss.sss | Subtracts a specified number of weekdays (x) from NOW, and sets the time to the value specified after the@sign. |\n\nFor example:\n\n| Expression | Result |\n| --- | --- |\n| NOW+2WD | Adds 2 weekdays to NOW |\n| NOW-7WD@1:59:59 | Subtracts 7 weekdays from NOW and the time value is 1:59:59 |\n| NOW+1WD | When value of NOW refers to Friday, the resulting day is next Monday |\n\n\n#### Business Days\n\nA business day is a day within the week where normal business operations are conducted.\nKX Dashboards\ndefines a business day by considering two pieces of information:\n- Days within the week that are used for work activity (for example, Monday through Friday)\n- Exclusionary dates on the calendar (for example, holidays recognized by the business)\nThe rolling feature allows you to specify what type of day to consider by using a special keyword\nBD\n. When\nBD\nis present, only business days are used to determine the calendar day.\nBD\ncan be used with the following data types:\ndate\n,\ndatetime\n,\ntimestamp\nBusiness day syntax includes:\n\n| Syntax | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| NOW+xBD | Adds a specified number of business daysxto NOW. |\n| NOW-xBD | Subtracts a specified number of business daysxfrom NOW. |\n| NOW+xBD@hh:mm:ss.sss | Adds a specified number of business daysxto NOW, and sets the time to the value specified after the@sign. |\n| NOW-xBD@hh:mm:ss.sss | Subtracts a specified number of business daysxfrom NOW, and sets the time to the value specified after the@sign. |\n\nFor example:\n\n| Expression | Result |\n| --- | --- |\n| NOW+2BD | Adds 2 business days to NOW |\n| NOW-7BD@9:00 | Subtracts 7 business days from NOW and the time value is 9:00 |\n| NOW+1BD | When value of NOW refers to December 31, and January 1 is not a business day, the result is January 2 |\n\n\n#### Defining the Workweek and Holidays\n\nWhen calculating business days, the rolling feature uses 2 files located on the web server where\nKX Dashboards\nhas been deployed. The website reference to these files is:\nhttp(s)://<website>/modules/<QuickBase Version>/calendar\nWhere\n<QuickBase Version>\nis the text that appears to the right of the QuickBase UI Component when viewing the\nUser Menu's About page\n. In the following screenshot, for the depicted About page, the website reference is: http(s)://<website>/modules/QuickBase_fd61a7a457/calendar\n\n| File | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| workweek.csv | This file defines which days of the week are considered work days.Each day of the week is represented by a number where 1 = Sun, 2 = Mon, etc.Only the first 7 valid entries are used.The entries can be separated by a new line or a comma.The initial version of this file defines Monday through Friday as work days:For example:2,3,4,5,6 |\n| holidayCalendar.csv | This file contains a list of exclusionary dates (e.g. holidays recognized by the business).Dates can be formatted as: YYYY-MM-DD or MM-DD-YYYYLeading zeroes are optional for the month and day (e.g.2024-1-1,2024-02-02)Acceptable (Year Month Day) delimiters are the hyphen, dot and forward slash characters (e.g.2024-01-01,2024.01.01,2024/01/01)The entries can be separated by a new line or a comma.The initial version of this file defines Jan 1, 2024 as a holiday:2024-01-01 |\n\nWarning\nIf the work week is not defined (i.e. workweek.csv file does not exist, cannot be read, or is an empty file), business days are not calculated.\n\n## View states in Query Editor\n\n\n### kdb+/q Query Editor\n\nView state parameters can be referenced from within the kdb+/q editor.\n\n#### 1.Function parameters\n\nFor a kdb+/q function, view states can be defined at the start of the function.\nAdd the required view state parameter enclosed in square brackets. Multiple view states can be defined by separating parameters with semi colons.\nNote\nThe maximum number of parameters permitted is 8; specifying more than eight parameters causes an error. You can avoid this restriction by encapsulating multiple parameters in a list or dictionary.\nq\nCopy\n\n```\n{[x]    select from table where (column1 = x) }\n```\n\nThis causes the supplied view state to be substituted for all occurrences of the parameter x, the expression to be evaluated and the result returned as the output value.\n\n#### 2.In-query parameters\n\nAlternative approach to add a view state parameter is to define an in-query parameter in a kdb+/q query, view states can be added to the query using the following syntax <%param%>.\nq\nCopy\n\n```\nselect from table where column1 = <%x%>\n```\n\nThis causes the supplied view state to be substituted for all occurrences of the parameter x, the expression to be evaluated and the result returned as the output value.\n\n### SQL Query Editor\n\nView state parameters can be referenced from within the SQL editor.\n\n#### 1.In query parameters\n\nIn your SQL query editor you can add a view state parameter to the query by using a set of double curly brackets e.g. {{trader}}.\nSQL\nCopy\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM table WHERE column1 = {{x}}\n```\n\nThis causes the supplied view state to be substituted for all occurrences of the parameter x, the expression to be evaluated and the result returned as the output value.\n\n### Map View states in Query Editor\n\nAs new data sources are defined in the kdb+/q Query Editor, it is often convenient to map them immediately to View States.\nThis can be done with a single click on the eye-and-gear button. The following example maps a queryâs\ntrade\nargument to an eponymous View State\nThis updates\nValue\nto reflect the mapped View State. For example,\n<%Query/value%>\nas mapped in the image below:\nTo edit the View State, click on the eye button to summon the Select View State dialog.\nWarning\nParameter types must match. A parameterâs type is defined in the View State dialog. Check to ensure the same type is assigned in the Query Editor for which the View State is assigned.\nIn the Query Editor, if there is an assigned value prior to creating a View State, the created View State will adopt the assigned value as the default value; ensuring the query will run when executed.\n\n## Selected values\n\nSelected Values\nare available in chart components. Values are captured using:\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Selected Value | A View State â âpublishingâ the selection for other components |\n| Selected Value Attribute | A column from the componentâsData Source |\n\nWarning\nWhen mapping Selected Values to Selected Value Attribute, ensure the data type of the View State matches the data type of the Data Source column; for example, integer for numbered data.\n\n## View State routing\n\nWhen a user selects a data row in\nData Grid\n, or line point in Charts, represented value(s) can be assigned to\nview state parameters\nin\nActions\nsection.\n\n### Sharing View States across dashboards\n\nWhen sharing View States between different dashboards, matching View States (case sensitive) must be created on the host and destination dashboard. \nThis is relevant when creating\nButtons\nto switch between dashboards.\n\n## Linking components\n\nComponents can be linked so that changes in one component are reflected in another.\nFor example, drilling down on the\nPivot Grid\nbelow results in changes to the linked\nBreadcrumbs\nand\nCanvas Chart\n.\nDrill-down on the data grid also updates breadcrumbs and canvas bar chart, as shown here.\nLink components by creating a\nView State\nand setting it as the\nFocus\nproperty of the linked components.\n\n## System View States\n\nSystem view states contain information about the current Dashboard session and are accessible to all components of the dashboard.\nThe following screenshot shows the\nView State\ndialog with a selected System View State, its properties, and a graphical representation of its relationship to a Dashboard component\nThe\nSettings\nfolder contains the system view states. Users cannot edit this folder or edit view states that appear in this folder.\nThe following is a list of the system view states:\n\n| View state | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| dashboardStartTimestamp | Provides the date and time for when the dashboard was opened (in UTC format) |\n| dashboardTimezone | Provides the timezone associated with the Dashboard session. TheDashboard User Menuprovides a dialog to access this timezone setting. |\n| dashboardTitle | Provides the title of current dashboard. TheNameproperty in theDashboard Basics sectioncan be used to maintain this value. |\n| dashboardUrl | Provides the url of the current dashboard |\n| dashboardUser | Identifies the user currently logged in to theKX Dashboardssession |\n\n\n## Clean Up\n\nClicking on\nClean Up\nopens the\nUnused View States\ndialog.\nThe\nUnused View States\ndialog shows a list of view states not used by the Dashboard. To remove one or more view states, check the checkbox next to its name, and then click\nDelete Selected\n. To select the entire list, check the topmost checkbox labelled\nView States\n.\n\n## Viewstate Persistence\n\nViewstates represent the user's dashboard layout, selections, filters, panel states, and other UI-driven configuration choices. Dashboards support two persistence mechanisms:\n- Local Storageâ Used when the user is in QuickView mode without asessionIDin the URL.\n- Server-side File Storageâ Used when the dashboard is accessed with asessionIDURL parameter.\n\n### 1. QuickView Mode (NosessionIDin URL)\n\n\n#### Saving Viewstates\n\nWhen a user is in QuickView mode and clicks the\nSave\nbutton:\n- The current viewstate is serialized.\n- The serialized viewstate is written toLocal Storageon the user's device.\n- The viewstate is stored under a dashboard-specific key.\n\n#### Applying Saved Viewstates\n\nWhen the dashboard is reopened without a\nsessionID\nâ by reloading the page, opening a new browser session, or returning later â the app will:\n- Check Local Storage for a saved viewstate for that dashboard.\n- If found, automatically apply the stored configuration.\nNote\nCharacteristics\n:\n- Saved only for the local user.\n- Does not sync across browsers or devices.\n\n### 2. Opening Dashboard with asessionIDParameter\n\nWhen a dashboard is loaded using a URL like\n/dashboard?sessionID=<ID>\n, persistence is handled via server-side files.\n\n#### Saving Viewstates\n\n- The viewstate is serialized when the user clicksSave.\n- The viewstate is written to a server-side file associated with the providedsessionID.\n\n#### Loading Viewstates\n\nWhen any user opens a dashboard with the same\nsessionID\nthe system will:\n- Attempt to load the viewstate file for thatsessionID.\n- If the file exists, apply the saved viewstate automatically.\nNote\nCharacteristics\n:\n- Viewstate persists across users and devices that use the samesessionID.\n- Useful for sharing configurations.\n\n### Viewstate Loading Logic Summary\n\n\n| Scenario | save location | loaded from | scope |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| QuickView (nosessionID) | Local Storage | Local Storage | Per-user, per-device |\n| QuickView +sessionID | Server-side file | Server-side file | Shared across users with the same sessionID |\n\n\n### Example Workflow\n\n\n#### User WithoutsessionID\n\n- User opens dashboard normally.\n- Enters QuickView mode â clicksSave.\n- Viewstate saved to Local Storage.\n- User reloads page â dashboard loads saved viewstate automatically.\n\n#### User WithsessionID\n\n- User opens:/dashboard?sessionID=abc-123.\n- Enters QuickView mode â clicksSave.\n- Viewstate saved to server as a file forabc-123.\n- Another user opens/dashboard?sessionID=abc-123.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- Navigate the workspace\n- Configure data sources\n- Use actions",

    "text": "\n# Explore Dashboard Components\n\nThis page provides an introduction to the components that can be added to your Dashboards.\nKX Dashboards\nsupports over 40 components, which can be added to your dashboards. When you start\nKX Dashboards\nyou are greeted with sample dashboards showcasing many of these components. For example, the following example includes a Navigation Menu, Data Grid, ChartGL, Radar Chart, Canvas Chart, Text.\n\n## Components\n\nKX Dashboards\nprovides pre-installed components providing out-of-the-box functionality while custom components allow for complete extensibility. These components are organized into categories described in the following sections.\n\n### Grids\n\nGrid components are structured, tabular elements for viewing and interacting with row-and-column data. The Data Grid handles flat tables; the Pivot Grid adds OLAP-style drill-down and aggregation for multi-dimensional analysis.\nGrid components\n\n| Data Grid | Tabular data display and handling. |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pivot Grid | OLAP drilldown data display. |\n\n\n### Charts\n\nA suite of charting widgets spanning 2D and 3D visualizations.

    "text": "\n# Configure Data Source Connections\n\nThis page guides you through the key steps and configurations for working with data sources in\nKX Dashboards\n, from creating queries and connections to enabling real-time updates and mapping results\nA data source is used to retrieve data, from connected\ndatabases\n, for use by dashboard components.\nRefer to\nWorking with Data Sources\nfor an introduction to the essential concepts you need to understand when connecting and working with data sources.\nThe following sections are included in this page:\nno toc\n- Configure a data source\n- Create data source queries, using kdb+/q, SQL, python and more\n- Configure data source connections\n- Set data source subscription types\n- Additional data source configuration including, auto-execute and max rows\n- Configure pivot queries for pivot grid components\n- Configure update queries to make permanent changes to source data from the data grid component\n- APIs available for Insights integration\n- View and map results from a data source to view states\n\n## Configure a data source\n\nTo configure a component's data source:\n- Open theDatadialog, as shown below, by either:Clicking on the database iconat the top of the properties panel orClicking the componentâsData Sourceproperty. Note that this property can be in different property sections for different components. In this example it is in theBasicsproperties.\n- ClickNewto create a new data source and give it a name.\n- Select a connection or connection group, from the connection selector, as shown below.Read more about connections here.\n- Create adata source query, as described here.\n- ClickExecuteto run the query. If the query is successful theResultstable populates with the query results, as shown below. Otherwise an error is displayed.See here for more about results.\n- ClickApplyto save the changes made to the data source and/orSelect Itemto choose the selected data source for the component property.\n\n## Create a data source query\n\nThere are a variety of options for creating data source queries, as follows:\n- SQL- to create a query using SQL query text. If this option is not availablesee here for how to get it.\n- kdb+/q- to create a query using kdb+/q query text.\n- Builder- to build a query using input nodes.\n- Analytic- to pick from a pre-defined list of functions.\n- Python- to build a python query. This option is greyed out if PyKX and dashboard specific PyKX dependencies are not installed.\n- Streaming- to build a real-time streaming query.\n- Virtual- to build a query using javascript.\n- #if DIRECT\n- #endif\n- #if DIRECT\n- #endif\n- #if DIRECT INSIGHTS\n- #endif\n\n### SQL\n\nPlease note that the SQL query functionality is not available by default. To access this feature:\n- Licensed users contact your account executive for more information.\n- Free Trial users install eitherkdb Insights Personal Editionorkdb Insights Core\nSQL queries use text-based SQL to query data from the database. Enter the following SQL query in the\nSQL\ntab of the\nData\ndialog.\nSQL\nCopy\n\n```\nSELECT * FROM TradeData\n```\n\nThe following screenshot displays this simple SQL query which returns all column data in the TradeData table from the html5evalcongroup connection.\n\n### kdb+/q\n\nYou can use text-based q to query data from the database. For example enter the following in the kdb+/q query screen:\n- #if PLATFORM\n- #endif\n- #if DIRECT INSIGHTS\nq\nCopy\n\n```\nFXTradeData\n```\n\nThe following screenshot shows this simple q query which returns all column data in FXTradeData table from the html5evalcongroup connection.\n- #endif\n- #if DIRECT\n\n### Builder\n\nVisual queries allow dashboard users, with no programming experience, to build queries using a range of configurable dialogs.\n- SelectBuilderand expand the editor to full screen mode.\n- Select a data node in the menu of available data sources. You can type in the name of the node in the search box as in the following example, where the TradeData node is entered and selected.\n- Right-click on an existing node to add one of the following:FilterUpdateGroup ByJoinFunction\n- Each node-type displays its own unique dialog used to define the query, as illustrated below.Read about using data filters to build a where clause.\n- Queries can be linked toview state parameters. For example, the filter node below has aWhereclause that filters for items equal to the View State parameterAsset.\n- ClickExecuteto run the query. Then clickApplyorClose.Read more about building visual queries.\n- #endif\n- #if DIRECT INSIGHTS\n\n#### Streaming query\n\nStatic and real-time data can be combined where data shares the same node.  The following example connects static fundamental data for equities to streaming equity prices, using the ticker symbol as a join between the data sets.  This data is available when you install\nKX Dashboards\n.\n- In theDatadialog selectBuilderand search and select the streaming data sourcelist. The parameterxcan be left unassigned as this is handled by thejoin.NoteIn the Data editor, streaming data sources have a colored icon and static data sources are black.\n- Right-click onlistnode and selectAdd Join, as shown below.\n- For thejoinnode, right-click toAdd Data Source, as shown below.\n- Selectfundamentalsfrom the Stocks folder, as shown below. This is a static data source of stock fundamentals.\n- Define how the data sources are connected. There has to be a common key between each data source to create the join, in this case,sym.Left click on theLeft Joinnode and clickEdit Join.Check the key that connects the two data sources; only shared keys are selectable. A left join adds content matched by the key from the right table to the left table.\n- ClickExecuteto run the query.\n- #endif\n\n#### Streaming using KX Insights SDK\n\nKX Dashboards provides built-in support for streaming data from KX Insights pipelines and streaming tables. When connected to a KX Insights environment, dashboards can subscribe to live data using WebSockets through the Service Gateway.\nWhen running on Kubernetes and spcoord is available:\n- The Pipelines and Tables/Topics fields are pre-populated.\n- Dropdown lists automatically show:\n- This ensures users can select only valid, deployed streaming sources.\nWhen spcoord is not available:\n- The input fields become free-text.\n- Users must manually enter:\n- Dashboards cannot auto-discover available streaming resources in this mode.\nUse filters to restrict the data received from a streaming source. When filters are applied, the filter parameters are included in the subscription request and evaluated by the streaming service.\nWhen applying filters, consider the following:\n- Filters can be configured within the componentâs Streaming Options panel.\n- Each filter corresponds to a column or field in the incoming stream.\n- Filters are sent as request parameters when establishing the WebSocket subscription.\n\n### Analytic\n\nAnalytics are pre-defined functions with required input parameters exposed in the dashboard. The following screenshot shows a sample analytic.\n- #if PLATFORM\n- #endif\n- #if DIRECT INSIGHTS\nAnalytics can be loaded directly into the q process\nThere is sample analytics loaded as part of demo.q in the sample folder.\n- #endif\n\n### Python\n\nThe option to write Python queries enhances\nKX Dashboards\ncapabilities by leveraging the functionality of the PyKX library for interacting with kdb+/q databases.\nNote\nThis functionality is supported for PyKX versions 2.3.1 or higher. To use python queries you must install PyKX and dashboard specific PyKX dependencies as follows:\n- Install PyKX as describedhere.\n- Once installed please ensure you can run PyKX within a q session following the outlinehere\n- Load the PyKX Dashboard extension, using the following command:PythonCopyq)\\l pykx.qq).pykx.loadExtension[\"dashboards\"]\nClick here for more information on PyKX.\nTo write Python queries:\n- Click thePythonradio button in theDatadialog. IfPyKXis not installed this option is greyed out.\n- Enter the python query in thePythontab. For example enter the following query.PythonCopyimportrandomdeffunc():x =10;random_size = random.randint(1,x)return[[5for_inrange(random_size)]for_inrange(random_size)]This simple Python function generates a random 2D list with dimensions NxN, where N is a random integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive). Each element in the list is set to the value 5.NoteThe parsing logic for the Python function string definition operates such that the first function that is defined within the code block is used as the callable function. Specifically this means that any import statements prior to the function definition are executed, usable and valid but any functions defined following the first function are ignored.\n- ClickExecuteand view the output in theResultspanel, as shown below.\n\n#### View States with python queries\n\nView states store values accessible to all components of the dashboard,\nclick here to read more about view states\n.\nYou can use view states in Python queries. The following example shows the randomD function which generates a pandas DataFrame with random values and timestamps. The random values are uniformly distributed between 0.5 and 13.3, and the timestamps start from the given date, with the date being passed in as a view state.\nYou can use multiple view states by separating them with commas, as in (viewstate1, viewstate2, viewstate3). The following example shows 3 View States; sizeV, lowV, and highV.\nNote\nThe definition of Python functions and their use as view states presently only supports positional arguments as outlined above. Use of keyword arguments is not supported when defining Python functions.\n- #if DIRECT\n- #endif\n\n### Streaming\n\n- #if PLATFORM\n- #endif\n- #if DIRECT INSIGHTS\nThe following video describes the steps to create a kdb+ streaming process.\nThis section describes how to build a streaming, time series data set to display in a chart at 60 fps.\n- Create a streaming q process on an assigned port; for example,stream.qon port 6814:PythonCopy`C:\\User\\Desktop\\Direct\\sample>q stream.q -p6814`\n- stream.quses a sinewave to generate sample data over time:qCopy/ define stream schemawaves:([]time:`timestamp$(); r:`float$(); o:`float$(); y:`float$(); g:`float$(); b:`float$(); p:`float$());/ loadandinitialize kdb+tick/ all tablesinthe top-levelnamespace(`.) become publish-able\\l tick/u.q.u.init[];/ sinwave/ t, scalar t represents position along a single line/ a, amplitude, the peak deviation of the functionfromzero/ f, ordinary frequency, the number ofoscillations(cycles) that occur each second of time/ phase,specifies(inradians) whereinits cycle the oscillationisat t =0.math.pi:acos -1;.math.sineWave:{[t;a;f;phase] a * sin[phase+2*.math.pi*f*t] }/ publish stream updates.z.ts:{ .u.pub[`waves;enlist `time`r`o`y`g`b`p!(.z.p,{.math.sineWave[.z.p;1.4;1e-10f;x]-0.4+x%6} each til6)] }.u.snap:{waves} // reqd. by dashboards\\t16// ring buffer writesina loop.ringBuffer.read:{[t;i] $[i<=count t; i#t;i rotate t] }.ringBuffer.write:{[t;r;i] @[t;(i mod count value t)+til1;:;r];}// cache updatesforthe snapshot.stream.i:0-1;.stream.waves:20000#waves;// generateandsave new record to buffer.stream.wavesGen:{res: enlist `time`r`o`y`g`b`p!(.z.p,{(x%6)+.math.sineWave[.z.p;1.4;1e-10f;x] -0.4} each til6);.ringBuffer.write[`.stream.waves;res;.stream.i+:1];res}/ generate & publish waves.z.ts:{ .u.pub[`waves;.stream.wavesGen[]] }// implement snapshot function.u.snap:{[x] .ringBuffer.read[.stream.waves;.stream.i] }\n- Create a data connection in dashboards to the streaming process on the selected port.\n- Select the data source, keyed bytime.\n- #endif\n\n### Virtual\n\nVirtual queries are built using Javascript and utilize data pre-loaded to the client. Assigned data sources in a virtual query do not re-query the database.\nVirtual queries can meld data from more than one data source,\nview state parameter\nor text insert.\nNote\nDue to the processing optimizations inherent to\nChartGL\n, the chartGL component does not currently support virtual queries\nSelect\nVirtual\nand enter the following Javascript.\nJavaScript\nCopy\n\n```\nfunction(source, viewstate, text, callback) {   var result = {        \"columns\": [            \"Data Source\",            \"View State\",            \"Text\"        ],        \"meta\": {            \"Data Source\": 9,            \"View State\": 11,            \"Text\": 11        },        \"rows\":[]    }    result.rows= _.map(source.rows, function(row) {        return {            \"Data Source\": row.Month,            \"View State\": viewstate,            \"Text\": text        };    });    callback(result);}\n```\n\nIn this example, shown below, a result object is created with the following properties; columns (Data Source, View State and Text), meta and rows. Each row from the source.rows array is mapped to a new object with the specified properties:\n- Data Source- Taken from the row.Month value.\n- View State- Set to the view state provided.\n- Text- Set to the text provided.\nNote\nThe meta definitions are the kdb+\ndatatypes\nfor each column where\ncolumns\nare the names of your table headers.\n- Read the Lodash documentation for more on supported functions.\n\n## Rolling view states in data source queries\n\nData sources with parameters have a checkbox labelled\nUse Rolling Syntax\nfor each viewstate parameter that has rolling syntax defined. When checked, the re-interpreted rolling syntax is passed as a parameter to the data source and also update sthe viewstate's value\nThis feature is available with the following data source types: SQL, kdb+/q, Analytic, Python, Streaming and Virtual.\nFor example:\n- Create a data source using akdb+/q data query. Add a query that uses a parameter value and outputs the value of that parameter as shown below.PythonCopy{[param]param: param}\n- Click on the eye icon to open theView Statedialog.\n- Create a view state with rolling syntax as describedhere.The following example shows a view state calledtomorrowwith rolling syntax ofNOW+24:00.\n- ClickSelect Itemto apply this to the data source.\n- TheDatadialog is updated with the view state parameter and because this view state has rolling syntax aUse Rolling Syntaxcheckbox is now visible.\n- When you execute the query the value from the view state is used for the parameter input. The results shown vary, depending on whetherUse Rolling Syntaxis checked.Checked- The results show tomorrow's date (exactly 24 hours from now). If youExecuteagain the value updates to exactly 24 hours from the time you clickedExecute. \nAdditionally, when the rolling syntax is used for the parameter Value, theValueof the view state is also updated with the re-interpreted rolling syntax.Unchecked- The results show the same date and time from the view state dialog. If youExecuteagain the value doesn't change.\n- Note that once you clickApplyyou cannot edit theRolling Syntaxstatus of the associated view state. If you attempt to edit the view state theRolling Syntaxcheckbox is disabled because it is in use by a data source.\n\n## Subscriptions\n\nThe following types of data source subscription are supported:\n- Static\n- Polling\n- Streaming\n- #if PLATFORM\n- #endif\n\n### Static\n\nThis is the default setting and involves a single request for data.\n- #if PLATFORM\n- #endif\n\n### Polling\n\nPolling involves a client-side poll of the database. This is a direct client request to the database. Server paging can be enabled to limit the amount of data returned to the dashboard.\n\n| Option | Effect |\n| --- | --- |\n| Interval | Time between client poll requests |\n| Key | Select which data source column to define Subscription handling; e.g. to have continual or static update |\n| Force Reset | By default, for updating data sources,KX Dashboardsmerges updates from the server with its existing dataset, unless a parameter is changed in which case the existing dataset is cleared.

Returns eitherTest succeed: Connection OK, orTest failed: Error\n- Save- to save details of connection\n- Close- to close the window\nThe screenshot below shows the connection properties, which vary by selected\nType\n. The table lists all properties and indicates their applicability to each connection\nType\n:\n\n| Property | Description | Type |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Name | Enter a name for the connection.. | Both |\n| Type | The connections options are:kdb: Select this when you are connecting tokdb.insights SDK: Select this when you are connecting tokdb Insights SDK.For information on integrating with kdb Insights SDK seehere.These must be actively deployed and running for a successful connection.The fields displayed change dynamically depending on the selectedType. | Both |\n| Host/Port | Enter the server name or IP address of the connection host and the port to be used | Both |\n| User | The username is required when TLS is enabled. | kdb |\n| Password/Confirm Password | A password is required when TLS is enabled | kdb |\n| TLS | Enabling Transport Layer Security (TLS) allows users to encrypt their kdb+ connection.\nkdb+ version 3.4 onwards supports TLS connections. | kdb |\n| SG Query Port (IPC) | The SG Port (Service Gateway Port) in the Connection Manager is the port used to communicate with the Service Gateway layer of the system. This gateway is responsible for routing and handling dashboard-to-database interactions, including authentication, metadata retrieval, and running queries.When a dashboard connects through the SG Port, all communication flows through the Service Gateway rather than directly to the database process. All query API calls made through dashboard are sent via qIPC (q Inter-Process Communication) to kdb+ processes.SeeService Gateway configurationfor details. | insights SDK |\n| SG Streaming Port (HTTP) | The Streaming Port is the HTTP endpoint exposed by the Service Gateway for all real-time data streaming operations. Streaming subscriptions use WebSockets initiated over HTTP. This is the port specified when the pipeline was created, as described inthis example. | insights SDK |\n| HTTPS | When checked, https protocol is used (otherwise http is used). | insights SDK |\n\n- #if PLATFORM\n- #endif\n\n### Dynamic Connections\n\nThe previous section described how to\nconfigure a static (predefined) connection\n.\nIt is also possible to bind a data source connection to a view state, allowing the connection to change dynamically at runtime based on user interaction or other component state.\nFor example, you may need to configure multiple versions of the same screen, one per environment or logical grouping. While the screen layout and logic remain consistent across versions, the underlying data sources must route to different connections based on the selected variant. To support this,\nKX Dashboards\nallows connection details  to be specified dynamically using view states.\nTo configure a  dynamic connection:\n- In the Data Source dialog click on the View State icon to open theView Statedialog.\n- Create the View State for the connection bindingas described here.\n- When you select the new view state:The  dropdown, listing available connections is hidden.A new view states container displays:The selected view state.A clear view state button. When the clear view state button is clicked, the view state is removed and the connection drop down is displayed.A tooltip that shows the view state value.At runtime:The data source uses the current value of the view state as the active connection.Changing the view state updates the connection used by the query without reconfiguring the data source.\n\n## Additional data source configuration\n\n\n### Auto-execute\n\nThis controls whether the data source automatically executes when an input parameter is changed or on load.\n- Checked - The data source automatically executes whenever an input parameter is changed or on load ifmappingis used. This is the default.\n- Unchecked - Subsequent parameter changes do not execute the query. However, it still executes normally if associated with a component, e.g., adata gridon load, or as anactiontied to abutton.\n- #if PLATFORM\n- #endif\n\n### Max Rows\n\nThis specifies the max number of rows of data that can be returned for any subscription type. The default is 2,000 rows.\n- #if PLATFORM\n- #endif\n\n### Clean Up\n\nClick\nClean Up\nto open the\nUnused Data Sources\ndialog, shown below.\nThis displays a list of data sources that are not being used by the dashboard. To remove one or more data source definitions:\n- Tick the checkbox next to its name\n- ClickDelete Selected\n- To select the entire list, check the topmost checkbox labeledData Sources.\n\n## Pivot query\n\nPivot queries are used by the\nPivot Grid\ncomponent.\nPivot data are split between independent variables (Breakdown Cols) and dependent variables (Aggregates).  The following screenshot shows a pivot query.\n- #if PLATFORM\n- #endif\n- #if DIRECT INSIGHTS\n- #endif\nWarning\nNames for\nBreakdown Cols\nand\nAggregates\nare case-sensitive. If an error occurs, check that column-header names in the source database matches those used in the dashboard.\nThe order of the\nBreakdown Cols\ncan be changed using drag-and-drop, as shown below.\n\n### Client pivot\n\nIn a server pivot the data request is processed server-side and only viewed data is returned to the dashboard. Each pivot interaction creates a fresh server-side request. A client pivot requests all data on dashboard load, and processes all pivot interactions on the client.\nUse a server pivot for large data sets. For smaller data sets, a client pivot is faster. Click\nClient\nto create a client pivot as shown in the following screenshot.\nWarning\nAs a client pivot is not making a server request for data,\ncustom binary analytics\naggregate functions using q do not operate. Use Javascript functions to build custom binary analytics aggregate functions for client pivots.\nRead more about Javascript functions\nThe following screenshot shows an example of a multi-column client pivot.\n\n### Pivot breakdown via breadcrumbs\n\nThe order of the pivot breakdown can also be controlled by the dashboard end-user, with the\nBreadcrumbs\ncomponent.\n- Create aView State Parameter(for example,breakdown) and associate it with theVisible Breadcrumbsproperty in the Breadcrumbs componentâsSettings.\n- In the linked pivot query, set theBreakdown Colsto thebreakdownview state parameter.\n- The resulting output shows the breakdown elements laid out in the Breadcrumb component.  These can be dragged and repositioned to change the pivot order.\n\n### Column label\n\nIn the\nPivot Query\nscreen,\nColumn Label\ncan be used to support 2-dimensional pivots.  For example enter the following two-dimensional pivot query in the\nQuery\ntab.\nq\nCopy\n\n```\n{[n]  ([      hub:n?`CHIA`XASX;      country:n?`UK`USA`CANADA`FRANCE;      account:n?`4;      displayQueue:n?`NEW`ASSIGNED`CLOSED    ]    ncount:n?100) }\n```\n\nThe following screenshot shows a standard pivot using the above query.\nStandard Pivot\nIn the next screenshot you can see that\nColumn Label\nhas been set to\ndisplayQueue\nto create a 2D Pivot.\nNavigation of a OLAP / Pivot control requires enabling\nBreadcrumbs\nin a component, or linking with a Breadcrumbs component.\n\n### Aggregate functions\n\nFor Pivot Queries, you have the option to specify unary, binary or custom binary, aggregate analytics.\nThe following sections provide examples where\nselect from dfxQuote\nis the query and\nPivot\nis checked.\n- Unary analytics- takes a single input (Un)\n- Binary analytics- takes two inputs (Bi)\n- Custom binary analytics- take two inputs and performs a specific custom user-defined computation on them\nIn the\nPivot Query\npanel the following fields are set:\n- Breakdown Cols- The drill-down buckets, i.e. the independent variables\n- Aggregates- These are functions of the dependent variables. Unary functions aresum,avg,count,min,max.\n\n#### Unary analytic\n\nThe following screenshot shows an example of a unary analytic.\nIn this example the single input\nsum\nis used.\n\n#### Binary analytic\n\nThe following screenshot shows an example of a binary analytic.\n\n#### Custom binary analytics\n\nIn addition to the built-in functions, such as sum, avg, count, min, max, you can define custom binary functions that take two inputs and performs a specific custom user-defined computation on them.\n\n#### Example\n\nA standard built-in binary function is available as part of the VWAP Analytic (subVWAP) found in Demo Trading dashboard in the Dashboard evaluation pack.\nbSize\nis bid size. In this example the dividend is defined as the sum of the bidSize value multiplied bid value and the divisor is defined by converting the bidSize to long and get the sum of these long values.\nq\nCopy\n\n```\n{[a;b] sum[a*b] % (sum[`long $ a])};`bidSize\n```\n\n\n### Dynamic aggregate columns\n\nDynamic aggregate columns for pivot queries typically refers to a situation where you want to aggregate data dynamically based on certain conditions or parameters using view states (rather than hard-coding the aggregates). This is particularly useful when you have varying requirements for aggregation depending on the data or when you want the query to be adaptable to changes in the dataset\nTo enable, click the View State icon in the basic pivot query control.\nYou can use\nview states\nto define\nBreakdown columns\n,\nAggregate Columns\n,\nAggregate Functions\nand\nLabels\n. Each view state must be of type\nlist\nand each\nAggregate Column\nmust have a corresponding\nAggregate function\n.\nRemember to link to a\nBreadcrumbs\ncomponent for navigation control of the pivot.\n\n## Update query\n\nAn update query allows a user to make permanent changes to source data from the\nData Grid\n. For example, when adding a new client or customer. The update query requires both a query, and a settings check in Data Grid properties.\nNote\nIf using a keyed table, then the query must use the same value.\nNote\nTo ensure updates are returned to the user view,\nForce Reset\nmust be enabled.\nIn addition to using an update query, the\nData Grid\nrequires the following Basic properties to be set:\n- Edit Modeto beenabledorinstant\n- Enable Insert/Deleteto be checked.\nThe dashboard users then has an\nEdit\noption in their dashboard.\nThe dashboard user can make a change, as shown below.\nThe dashboard user can submit a change, as shown below.\nTip\nIf\nUpdate Query\nis enabled, all users with permissions for that dashboard can make changes. If you want only some read-only users to have edit permissions do the following:\n- Duplicate the dashboard.\n- SetEdit Modetodisabledand uncheckEnable Insert/Deletefrom the Data Grid properties.\n- Grant users who shouldnât have edit control permissions to access this duplicate dashboard.\n\n## API (for Insights Integration)\n\nThere are 3 types of APIs available in KX Dashboards when connecting to the KX Insights SDK:\n- getData - The getData API is the primary endpoint for retrieving full datasets\n- getPreview - The getPreview API is used to generate lightweight preview data\n- Insights UDAs - User-Defined APIs (UDAs) allow developers to extend KX Dashboards with custom backend logic for retrieving data. UDAs are implemented on the client application's backend (via the Insights SDK). They appear automatically within Dashboards when the client application exposes them. UDAs can be used to run custom queries, apply business logic, transform data, or integrate external systems.\n\n## Results\n\nWhen you click\nExecute\non a data source query the results are displayed in the\nResults\npanel at the bottom of the screen. This panel has 3 tabs:\n- Results\n- Mapping\n- Raw Output\nPerformance metrics are also displayed to indicate query performance. The\nRoundtrip\ntime, for the query to execute, is displayed in milliseconds above the results.\n\n### Results\n\nResults are displayed in the\nResults\ntab in the\nResults\npanel, as shown below.\nIf the query does not execute an error is displayed, as shown below.\n\n### Mapping\n\nMapping configuration is accessible from the\nMapping\ntab in the\nResults\npanel, as shown below. Through this tab you can map results from a data source to view states.\nTo create mappings, the results must include a column that contains keys and a column that contains values. Key and value columns are returned in the\nKey\nand\nValue\ndropdowns.\n- Click+to add a new mapping.\n- Select aKeyand specify theView Statethat theValuemaps to.You can selectKeyvalues using the dropdowns or type them into the dropdown input field and press enter.\n- Click theReseticon to repopulate the list of mappings with all available keys.\n\n### Raw Output\n\nRaw output is displayed in the\nRaw Output\ntab in the\nResults\npanel. This information gives you further insights that maybe helpful for debugging. It presents exact unformatted data that is returned by the query.\nThe raw data is comprised of the following elements:\n- an array of column names\n- an object mapping column names to their kdb types\n- an array of row objects which map columns to values\n\n## Next Steps\n\n- Continue adding components to your workspace\n- Configure additional component properties\n- Publish your dashboard",

A drilldown is performed when the user clicks on the plus sign (+) that appears in front of the breakdown value. The additional information comes from the presentation of more breakdown columns.\nThe following screenshot shows a Breadcrumbs component and a Pivot Grid with the optional Pivot Grid tools.\nThis page provides details on how to:\n- Set up a Pivot Grid\n- Configure Pivot Grid properties\n- AdjustPivot Grid column layout\n\n## Set up a Pivot Grid\n\nTo set up a Pivot Grid component, click-and-drag the component into the workspace and configure the following:\n- Define thedata source, and ensure the Pivot checkbox is checked to complete thePivot Querysection in the dialog.\n- Set theFocusproperty to align withBreadcrumbscomponent. The use of a breadcrumb component is optional.\n- Configurebreakdownandaggregatecolumn formats.\nRefer to Pivot Grid properties described in the next section for details on additional properties.\n\n## Pivot Grid properties\n\nThe following sections provide details on how to configure the properties of the Pivot Grid component.\n\n### Basics\n\nOpen the Basics properties on the right and configure the properties described in the following table.\n\n| Field | Description |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Name | A name for the component provided by the user. |  |\n| Data Source | Define the source data for the grid. Ensure that the Pivot checkbox is checked and the Pivot Query section is filled in. |  |\n| Focus | AView State Parameterused forlinking components. | ` |\n| Single Column Drilldown | This setting can limit the number of displayed breakdown columns to one.When unchecked, expanding a breakdown value (drilling down) adds the next breakdown column to the grid.When checked, drilling down uses and shows a single column to display breakdown values. In the example below, when the user drills down to src only the src column is shown. |  |\n| Allow Multiple Paths | When checked, allow multiple breakdown values from the same column to be selected (for example. OLAP drilldown). Using this feature disables Single Column Drilldown Drilldown mode by unchecking its property. |  |\n| Drilldown Input Area | Use this to specify the area within a breakdown cell that serves as the input control to perform a drilldown.The options are:Breakdown Cell: When this is selected, the area used to perform a drilldown is the entire cell.+/-: When set to+/-, the+or-serves as the input control to perform a drilldown and all other areas within the cell can be used to processClick/Double ClicktriggerActionsor perform Row/CellSelections.NoteTheSelectionandClick/Double ClickTrigger Action features are not available for subtotal summary data.Breakdown values with the preceding-are considered subtotal summary data and cannot be selected or processed byClick/Double ClickTrigger Actions.Subtotal Summary Data appears on rows where the last visible breakdown value (from left to right) displays the-prefix.Aggregate values appearing on subtotal rows cannot be selected or processed byClick/Double ClickTrigger Actions. |  |\n| Show Tools | When selected, displays user controls forSingle Column Drilldown,FiltersandFile Exportoptions.NoteThe Pivot Grid's Filter feature has limited support for regular expressions. |  |\n| Animate | Offer smoothing animation on drilldown versus a 'hard' drilldown. |  |\n| Show Expand All Button | When checked, the plus or minus sign appears in the header of breakdown columns as input controls allowing users to expand or collapse all breakdown values in its column. .Within a breakdown column, the Expand All button is visible in the column header if there is a least one expandable value within that column. Clicking on the Expand All button in the column header will expand all expandable values within that column.Within a breakdown column, if all the values are expanded, the Expand All button is replaced with a minus sign, allowing the user to collapse all values within that column.The following example shows a Pivot Grid with theShow Expand All Buttonfeature enabled. |  |\n| Show Expanded Summary | For a drilldown row, when checked the parent summary values are included otherwise only the child drilldown values are shown.The following example shows an expanded parent summary row. |  |\n| Aggregate Function Tooltip | When checked, a tooltip identifying the aggregate function appears when you hover over the aggregate detail.The example below shows a tooltip identifying the aggregate function calledAverage.If a custom function is specified, the tooltip displays the textAnalytic. |  |\n| Use Cached Columns | If checked, for new aggregated or breakdown columns it takes the column data from the column cache if present. |  |\n| Show Cached Columns | When checked theCached Columnsproperties are displayed. |  |\n| Sort Column/Sort Order | Sort ColumnandSort Orderdefine the default sort order,ascendingordescending, for the selected data source column on load. |  |\n| Scroll Value | A number representing the distance in pixels from the top of the pivot grid to the currently visible scroll position. |  |\n| Keep User Customizations | When checked,changes to a column size orcolumnpositionare automatically saved for the end-user and these changes are applied to the Pivot Grid when the Dashboard reloads.When the Breakdown Cols value in the Pivot Grid's Data source is specified using a view state, the end-user must click on the \"Save View State\" button in order for the changes to the breakdown column position to be preserved.The Reset View State button can be used by the end-user to restore the original column widths and column positions. |  |\n| Column Width Mode | Select the method for calculating the width of columns in the Pivot Grid. The column width is calculated when:The Pivot Grid's initial display is renderedThe Pivot Grid is resizedA column is added or removedThe browser window is resized, causing the Pivot Grid to change its sizeThere are three column width modes that determine how the columns behave when the column width(s) need to be calculated:Relative- The size of the columns are dynamic and are based on the size of the Pivot Grid. The column width is calculated when columns are introduced, removed, or the width of the Pivot Grid is changed, so that all of the component's horizontal space is used. This is the default mode.Fixed- The column widths do not change when the Pivot Grid increases/decreases in size or when columns are added/removed. This is useful when you don't want the size of the column to be influenced by the size of the grid or the browser window.Fixed for User resized columns, otherwise Relative (Mixed Mode)- This is a combination of Relative and Fixed modes. The width of a column is relative to the size of the Pivot Grid unless the end-user resizes that column. When the end-user resizes a column, its column width is fixed.The option selected here determines whetherRelative WidthorFixed Widthis displayed in theBreakdownandAggregateColumn properties.NoteConflicting Column Width ModesIf the Dashboard author changes the Column Width Mode after an end-user has saved column width sizes, the Column Width properties from the Dashboard supersede the saved end-user data. |  |\n\n\n### Breakdown columns\n\nBreakdown columns define how the data is grouped and organized in the pivot grid.

A visual guideline, that spans the full height of the component, becomes visible until the mouse button is released.\n- Release the mouse button once the desired width is visualized. The new column width is adjusted to this position.\nWhen columns are resized visually by the Dashboard author, the value of the\nRelative Width/Fixed Width\ncolumn property in the\nBreakdown\nand\nAggregate\ncolumns properties section are automatically updated.\nInformation\nTo preserve  column width changes made by the end-user, check the\nKeep User Customizations checkbox\nin the\nBasics\nproperties.\n\n### Reorder Pivot Grid columns\n\nThe following steps describe how to reorder the columns in a Pivot Grid.\n- Position the mouse over a column's header. The default tooltip specifies the name of the column and a hint about the features available to the user at that mouse position.\n- Left click and continue to hold down the mouse button:A label with the column name appears and moves with the mouse pointer.The mouse pointer image changes to a move cursor if the column can be moved to the target destination, or a not allowed cursor if the location is invalid.The other column type (breakdown/aggregate) has a strikethrough appearance to indicate to the user that the column being moved cannot be moved to that area.When moving the mouse across the pivot grid, a visual marker appears as an arrow pointing down to a vertical line spanning the component's height to show the intended destination of the moved column when the user releases the mouse button. The position of the marker is determined by the nearest applicable column boundary.If the pivot grid has a horizontal scrollbar, when the mouse is close to the left or right hand edge of the component, it is in theautomatic scroll zonewhen it is within 15% of the grid's visible width. In this scenario, the grid automatically scrolls in the direction of the nearest edge for the grid and the scrolling speed accelerates as the mouse moves closer to the component's edge.\n- Release the mouse button to move the column to the location indicated by the visual marker.InformationTo preserve column position changes made by the end-user, check theKeep User Customizations checkbox, in theBasicsproperties.\nNote\nWhen the Breakdown Cols value in the Pivot Grid's data source is specified using a view state, as shown below:\nThe end-user must click\nSave View State\nto preserve any reordering of breakdown columns when a view state is used to specify the breakdown columns in the data source.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- Navigate Dashboards workspace\n- Configure data source connections\n- Use view states\n- Publish & Export a dashboard",

When this is set, the list of dates in the data source sets the available dates presented by the date range component.Notekdb+ dataThe data source for this component must return values of kdb+ type \"date\".For example, the following kdb+/q syntax can be used to create a data source resulting in 365 sequential date values starting with March 1, 2024.qCopy([]d: (2024.03.01+ til365))Click here to read more about data sources |\n| Start Date Label | Enter a text label to be displayed beside the first date. |\n| End Date Label | Enter a text label to be displayed beside the second date. |\n| Selected Start Date | You can specify a view state parameter of typedate,datetime, ortimestampfor the start date. View States with time values are set to midnight. |\n| Selected End Date | You can specify a view state parameter of typedate,datetime, ortimestampfor the end date. View States with time values are set to midnight. |\n| Start Date Label Width | This defines the width in pixels for the first field label. |\n| End Date Label Width | This defines the width in pixels for the second field label. |\n| Input Field Width | This defines the width in pixels for both input fields. |\n| Input Field Orientation | This defines the layout (horizontal, vertical) for the input fields. |\n| Horizontal Alignment | This defines the horizontal position (left, center or right) for the input fields and labels within the component boundary. |\n| Vertical Alignment | This defines the vertical position (top, middle, bottom) for the input fields and labels within the component boundary. |\n| Tooltip | This is the text description which appears when you mouse over the Date Range Picker. |\n| Allow Keyboard Input | When this is checked, you can enter dates using thekeyboard. |\n\n\n### Using the Date Range Picker\n\nYou can provide input for the Date Range Picker with the mouse or keyboard:\n- Mouse Input\n- Keyboard Input\n\n#### Mouse Input\n\nTo use the Date Range Picker with mouse input:\n- In Preview mode or the End-User version of the Dashboard click on the start field to open the calendar.\n- A calendar is displayed and its position is aligned with the start date input field. If this display includes days within the date range, those days are highlighted.\n- Click on the desired start date.The start date field is updated with the selected value.A calendar is displayed and its position is aligned with the end date input field. If this display includes days within the date range, those days are highlighted.\n- Click on the desired end date. The end date field is updated and the calendar closes.\n\n#### Keyboard Input\n\nTo use the Date Range Picker with keyboard input:\n- In Preview mode or the End-User version of the Dashboard click on the start field to open the calendar. The calendar opens for the start date. Type in the desired date.\n- Click on the end field or press TAB to move to the end date field.A calendar is displayed and its position is aligned with the end date input field. If this display includes days within the date range, those days are highlighted.\n- Type in the desired end date.\n- Click outside of the component, or press TAB or Enter to complete the entry. The calendar closes.\n\n### Validation\n\nThis component verifies all values entered. If invalid data is entered, a label with a red border is displayed around the relevant input field, as shown below.\nValidation occurs as you are typing, selecting a date from the calendar, navigating to a different area of the Dashboard, and upon initialization. If a value is not valid, the selected Start/End Date properties are not updated, and one of the error labels in the following table appears:\n\n| Label | Error details |\n| --- | --- |\n| Invalid date | This appears when the value does not represent an actual calendar day. For example, if00is entered for the day). If you don't correct the date, the previously held values are used. |\n| Date out of scope | This is displayed when the date value is not in the list of available dates provided by the data source. This error label remains visible until a valid value is provided. |\n| Dates out of order | This is displayed when the start date does not occur before the end date. This error label remains visible until the condition is corrected.  When you enter dates that are out of order, both input fields have the red border.   When the date selection via mouse click causes this error, you are directed to the opposite end of the date range and prompted to enter its value. |\n\n\n### Using Date Range Picker with view states\n\nYou can use the Date Range Picker to set up view state parameters which can be used by another component.\nThe following example shows the Date Range Picker being used to provide the filter date for the data grid. The data is filtered based on the date range selected.\nIn the example above view state parameters have been set up for the Selected Start Date and Selected End Date properties in the basic properties. The data dialog with the 2 view states,\nstartDate\nand\nendDate\n, is shown below.\nClick here to read more about the view state dialog.\nThese view states are set up as inputs to the data source query for the Data Grid. The\nsd\nand\ned\nvariables are defined at the start of the function. These are mapped to the\nstartDate\nand\nendDate\nview states. This mapping is visible in the lower part of the data dialog, shown below.\nClick here to read more about referencing view states in the query editor.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- Navigate Dashboards workspace\n- Configure data source connections\n- Use view states\n- Publish & Export a dashboard",

Users can use Hide Filter to remove this field. |\n| Show Paging Control / Show Paging State | When these two options are checked, you can see pagination controls, which are used for large data sets. |\n| Enable Grouping | When checked, users can group data together. Subtotals can be applied withSummary Row For Groupings. |\n| Auto Collapse Grouping | When checked, the dashboard is loaded with Data Grid groupings in collapsed form. Grid groupings are configured inGrouping Columns. |\n| Keep NonExistent Columns | Non-existent columns are employed when working with many queries. If a Data Source is changed, the prior column configurations from the original is kept if this control is checked.Dynamic queries which donât have fixed column definitions can setKeep NonExistent Columnsto retain configuration options such as column formatting. In this scenario, the*wildcard would be used in theData Field Name. Hybrid wildcard usage is also supported; for exampleData\\*returns all columns with Data. |\n| Custom Layout | When checked, the Data Grid has a button to summon the Configuration dialog.The Configuration dialog lets users change the display of columns in the Data Grid.All columns are available to usersHidden columns are visible in theAvailable Columnslist. This may not be desirable if a hidden column stores a calculation or highlight rule operator. In such instances it may be necessary to disableCustom LayoutUser configuration is saved on exiting the dashboard and is available on next login.Retain Relative Column Widths on ReloadCheck this to continue with relative width on display columns (relative widths are applied only when columns fit allocated horizontal space, that is when the horizontal scrollbar is not visible). |\n| Edit Mode | Select one of the options;EnabledA user can edit data by clicking theEditbutton in the top-right corner, making each cell editable.DisabledWhen this is set users cannot edit cell contents.InstantWhen this is set boolean values in the table are rendered as checkboxes that users can toggle to instantly edit cell contents.In both cases, anupdate querymust be used. | Enabled | A user can edit data by clicking theEditbutton in the top-right corner, making each cell editable. | Disabled | When this is set users cannot edit cell contents. | Instant | When this is set boolean values in the table are rendered as checkboxes that users can toggle to instantly edit cell contents. |\n| Enabled | A user can edit data by clicking theEditbutton in the top-right corner, making each cell editable. |\n| Disabled | When this is set users cannot edit cell contents. |\n| Instant | When this is set boolean values in the table are rendered as checkboxes that users can toggle to instantly edit cell contents. |\n| Enable Insert/Delete | This is only used with anupdate query. |\n| Sort Column | Defines the column to sort data when the Data Grid is loaded. |\n| Sort Order | Defines the direction to sort data when the Data Grid is loaded. |\n| KDB Filter String | Used inserver-side filtering. |\n| Scroll Row | Stores a scroll value required for PDF Creation. |\n| Experimental Mode | Improved data handling efficiency and performance with high volume data |\n| Virtual Scroll | The options are:Disabled- This is the default and means all data is loaded to the dashboard from the Data Source.Uncached- When enabled, viewed data is loaded as required. For streaming or frequently changing data and update queries this setting is recommended,CachedThis enables backend data management. |\n| Expand When Creating Pdf | When checked, Data Grids are printed on multiple pages.Data Grids must be placed insideTab Control. If a header is present, it is printed on each page. Grouping is not supported. |\n| Footer Data Source | ThisData Sourceproperty can be used to provide customized values in the footer section of the Data Grid, as shown in the following example.Each column name returned by this data source becomes an additional option to choose from in the dropdown list of available footers. \n        Only the first row of values resulting from this data source are presented in the footer section of the Data Grid. |\n| Frozen Column Count | You can freeze one or more columns in the Data Grid. This allows the user to scroll horizontally through the Data Grid, while keeping some important columns visible at all times (such as ID or command column).This property defines the number of columns that are frozen starting at the first column to the left in the grid. |\n| Autosave | Use this to specify whether to retain column filters when a dashboard is reloaded. While this is generally enabled, there are times where users want to start with a clean slate to troubleshoot issues, apply different filters or potentially improve performance by not retaining the filter value. The options are:enabledFilters are saved and retained when the dashboard is reloaded.disable filterColumn filters are not saved and the dashboard reloads without them. |\n\n\n#### Server-side filtering\n\nWarning\nServer-side filtering is not used in KX Insights Platform Views\nTo use server-side filtering, set the value of\nFiltering\nto\nAdvanced Column Filter\nin the\nBasics\nproperties.\nThe following steps outline an example of setting up server-side filtering.\n- Create the following three view state parameters and group them in the view state parameter menu.Sort Column- This can be either string or symbol.Sort Order- This can be either string or symbol.KDB Filter String- This must be of type string.\n- Define adata sourceto be filtered. The following code snippet usesdfxQuoteas the target data set; replace as appropriate:\nq\nCopy\n\n```\n{[sortCol;sortOrder;filterString]    res:.dfilt.apply[dfxQuote; filterString];     if[all not null (sortOrder; sortCol);     sortOp:(`descending`ascending!(xdesc; xasc))sortOrder;     res:sortOp[sortCol;res]     ];     :res;     }\n```\n\n\n### Columns\n\nThrough the\nColumns\nproperties you can:\n- Configure properties for individual columns\n- Define properties for multiple columns\n\n#### Column\n\nFor each individual column in your Data Grid there is a section defining how its data is formatted. These properties are defined in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| User Defined | When checked, the selected column remains in the Data Grid if the selected column variable is removed from the query. This is effectively a lock on the column.This column shows as an empty column in the Data Grid if theUser Definedcolumn variable is missing in the query. |\n| Data Field Name | A column ordynamic columnfrom the Data Source.Dynamic column syntax\n                  use \\* or regex. For example; CPUCore\\*, FXpair\\*EUR, /symbol|sym/i |\n| Display Name | Columns with Display Names: Symbol, Counter Party, %, and Start DateDisplay Nameis set to wildcard whenData Field Nameuses the wildcard. Hybrid names using a mix of name label and wildcard are also supported. For example,Data Field Nameset to 'Data\\*' withDisplay Nameof 'Result \\*' returns columns including 'Data' with 'Result ' in theDisplay Name. |\n| Header Tooltip | Provides a rollover text description for the column. This is useful if the existing column title is clipped on browser resize. |\n| Width (relative) | Column width relative to other columns. For example; columns with a relative width of 20, 10, 5, 1 scale to column widths of 55% (that is 20/(20+10+5+1)), 28%, 14% and 3%. Columns resize with the browser window. |\n| Min Width (px) | The minimum width for a column in pixelsWhen usingWidth (relative)andMin Width (px)togetherWidth (relative)uses a default value based on the data Type in the column; in the case of a Data Grid the defaultWidth (relative)andMin Width (px)are the same.There are two priority rules forWidth (relative)andMin Width (px):If the screen is resized so that a scroll bar appears,Width (relative)is disabled and onlyMin Width(px)used. If a further resize removes the scrollbar,Width (relative)is appliedIf theWidth (relative)is set to zero, onlyMin Width (px)is applied.IfWidth (relative)(irrespective of scrollbar) narrows Data Grid column widths to less thanMin Width(px), thenMin Width(px)is used.When usingWidth (relative)orMin Width(px)it may be helpful to use the bulk parameter adjuster; clickCTRL + Select the columns to change, then adjust the required parameter(s) to have the value applied to all selected columns |\n| Text Align | Horizontal alignment of values in their cells. |\n| Sortable | When checked, clicking on a column header toggles between ascending and descending sorts. |\n| Format | Set the format for the data in the column. The options are:GeneralNumberFormatted NumberSmart NumberDateTimeDateTimePercentageBooleanSparkline |\n| Precision | The number of decimal places show for numeric data. |\n| Hide Trailing Zeroes | When checked, this suppresses trailing zeroes for numeric data. |\n| Currency Symbol | Set the currency symbol. The following example shows columns prefixed with currency symbols. |\n| Data Format/Time Format | WhereFormatisDate,Time, orDateTimethe data is formatted with these two settings. |\n| Negative Color | Set the color for negative values in the column. |\n| Highlight Changes | When this is enabled, higher than previous value changes are highlighted in green and lower values in red. |\n| Highlight Min Value/Highlight Max Value/Range Highlight | These checkboxes are used to set highlighting colors to be used for minimum and maximum values as well as ranges, as shown here. |\n| Invert Range Color | Flip range color usage; dark shade for high values, light shade for low values |\n| Percentage Color | A color, used for mini-bars whenFormatisPercentage.NoteMin Value Color,Max Value Color,Range Color, andPercentage Colorcan beView state parameters. |\n| Read Only | When checked, the column cannot be edited. |\n| Selectable | Checked by default. Column cells cannot be selected when unchecked. |\n| Template | Apply HTML customizations with Handlebar helpers; for example:{{column name}}where{{column name}}is the reference name for the column from the data source. |\n| Sparkline Options | Configuration forSparklines. |\n| Hidden | When checked the data column is hidden. IfFull Excel Exportis enabled, all hidden columns are downloaded as part of the export. Hidden columns are also available underCustom Layout. |\n| Footer | This property allows the user to specify what values are displayed in the footer section of the Data Grid. The options are;None,Average,Count,Sum, andWeighted Average.If at least one column has a Footer property set to a value other thanNone, the footer section appears as the last row at the bottom of the grid display. Footer values inherit the format options of their column.When aFooter data sourceis defined, the columns returned by this data source are appended as additional options to theFooterdropdown list.To create labels in the footer section, text can be used as a footer value even if the Column format is different.The Footer property is set to None if a custom footer is selected and the Footer Data Source changes to exclude the selected column. |\n| Footer Weight | Applies a weighting to the current column by selected data source variable. For this to be enabled,Footermust be set toWeighted Average. |\n| Header | Applies a column grouped header. Auto size applied on grouped header when user resize columns. Column reorder restricted within its group. |\n| Filter | Use this to save the current filter value for this column as a view state for use elsewhere. |\n| Raw Copy | This controls the format of data copied from datagrid cells. This is useful where the raw value may be required to provide greater accuracy and consistency.When checked the raw value is copied.When unchecked the display value is copied.In the following screenshot the timestamp column is formatted as MM/YYYY and HH mm and hasRaw Copyenabled.When this data is copied from the datagrid the raw data from the timestamp column is copied. |\n\n\n#### Multi Column Editor\n\nIn addition to the\nindividual column settings\n, you can define settings for all columns in the Multi Column Editor.\n- Click the edit column properties icon as shown below.\n- Select columns on the left using Ctrl-click on columns.\n- Select properties (settings) on the right to be applied across the selected columns.\n- Columns can be removed from a Data Grid by clicking the trashcan icon\n\n### Selection & Routing\n\nThe Selection & Routing properties are used to define what happens when areas of the Data Grid are selected.\n\n| Selection Mode | Once a selection mode is set, the user can select and highlight a specific region in the grid for bulk action like copy and paste. Select one of the following:AreaAllows for selecting a contiguous rectangular area of cells\n                    WhenAreais selected the user can select cells and rows using the following keyboard shortcuts.ShortcutDescriptionShift + EndSelect to the end of a column from a cell.Shift + HomeSelect to the top of column from a cell.Select + Page UpSelect from a cell to each page up instance.Shift + Page DownSelect from a cell to each page down instance.Select + ClickSelect a cell to click-select-cell.Drag-select-rowsSelect multiple rows.Single RowEnables the selection of only one row at a time.Multi RowPermits the selection of multiple rows simultaneously.CellAllows for selecting an individual cell within the grid. | Shortcut | Description | Shift + End | Select to the end of a column from a cell. | Shift + Home | Select to the top of column from a cell. | Select + Page Up | Select from a cell to each page up instance. | Shift + Page Down | Select from a cell to each page down instance. | Select + Click | Select a cell to click-select-cell. | Drag-select-rows | Select multiple rows. |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Shortcut | Description |\n| Shift + End | Select to the end of a column from a cell. |\n| Shift + Home | Select to the top of column from a cell. |\n| Select + Page Up | Select from a cell to each page up instance. |\n| Shift + Page Down | Select from a cell to each page down instance. |\n| Drag-select-rows | Select multiple rows. |\n| Row ID Column | For a given selected row, this is used to specify the column used in the selected row. This is defined from theData Sources. |\n| Selected Row | This property sets the value in the specified column ID for a selected row. It provides precise control over row selection, allowing actions to be applied to specific cells within the grid. This is assigned by aview state parameterwhenCellis selected. |\n| Selected Column | This property sets the value of the column header value for any selected cell. This is assigned by aView State parameterwhenCellis selected. |\n| Selected Cell Value | This property sets the value of selected cell. While the selected row always sets the value based on column ID, this property is independent of column id. This is assigned by aview state parameterwhenCellis selected. |\n| Follow Selected Value | When checked, row selection highlight retains the view on screen during a scroll event. |\n| Default Fallback on Deselect | When checked, the default View State Parameter values are used (if set) in the absence of a row select. |\n| Checkbox Alignment | Position of data row selection check boxes; select eithernone,leftorright. |\n| Select on checkbox only | Toggle whether the whole row can be selected or just the checkbox. |\n\n\n#### Action\n\nSee\nActions\nfor full details.\n\n### File export\n\nSee\nExport\nfor full details.\n\n### Tooltip\n\nSpecify the following tooltip properties.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Position | Set the tooltip position to eithernone,right,left, orcursor. |\n| Template | SeeTemplatesfor details. |\n| Use Formatted Cell Value | When this is checked the tooltip uses the formatted value from column template otherwise it uses the raw cell value. |\n\n\n### Grouping columns\n\nThe\nGrouping Columns\nproperties are used to group Data Grid rows by their values in that column. Specifying further grouping columns repeats this within each group.\nThe following screenshot shows grouping by sym and counterparty.\nDashboard users can also create groupings on the fly by dragging a column header into the space directly above the column headers, as shown here.\n\n### Summary Row for Groupings\n\nGrouping Columns\nreorganize the Data Grid layout.\nSummary Row for Groupings\nworks with the grouping columns by applying simple mathematical calculations to the groups. The following example shows Leverage calculated for each group.\nThe\nSummary Row for Groupings\nproperties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Aggregate Function | The mathematical function to apply to the group. The following functions are supported.AVG,SUM,MIN,MAXorWAVG. When you selectWAVG(weighted average), an additionalColumnproperty is displayed. |\n| Column | The column on which the calculations are made. |\n| Label | The text label to use for the calculation. |\n| Color | The font color for the grouping. |\n\n\n### Highlight rules\n\nHighlight rules\nuse colors to emphasize changes in data grid values.\nFor each rule select either\nGradient\nor monotone\nDiscrete\ncolors.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Name | The name of the rule. |\n| Target | The column on which the rule acts. This can be any column in the Data Grid. It does not have to be the column using the operator. |\n| Condition Source | SeeHighlight Rulesfor details. |\n| Condition Operator | SeeHighlight Rulesfor details. |\n| Condition Value | SeeHighlight Rulesfor details. |\n| Color | The text color when the rule is true. |\n| Background Color | The background cell color when the rule is true. |\n| Border Color | The cell border color when the rule is true. |\n| Icon | The icon to appear when the rule is true. |\n| Icon Color | The color for the icon (if used) when the rule is true. |\n\n\n### Custom filters\n\nCustom Filters\nintroduce client-side advanced filters for columns covering text, numeric and datetime formats.\nNote\nCustom Filters are available only whenFilteringis set toColumn FiltersorAdvanced Column Filters.\nFiltering is only applied to viewable data. Paging limits the results to the current page.\nSpecify a custom filter for each columns by setting the properties in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Name | Select a column to use for filtering. When you click this field, a dialog opens. |\n| Type | Set the type of filtering to be used. Select one of the values described below:SelectionFilter dropdown. Checks the available data options to display.Server SelectionSeeServer Selectionfor details.NumberSupport for filter options:<,>,>=,<=,=,==,!=(exclude)DateTimeSelect for Date or Time using standard operators:<,>,>=,<=,=DisabledNo filtering. | Selection | Filter dropdown. Checks the available data options to display. | Server Selection | SeeServer Selectionfor details. | Number | Support for filter options:<,>,>=,<=,=,==,!=(exclude) | DateTime | Select for Date or Time using standard operators:<,>,>=,<=,= | Disabled | No filtering. |\n| Selection | Filter dropdown. Checks the available data options to display. |\n| Server Selection | SeeServer Selectionfor details. |\n| Number | Support for filter options:<,>,>=,<=,=,==,!=(exclude) |\n| DateTime | Select for Date or Time using standard operators:<,>,>=,<=,= |\n| Disabled | No filtering. |\n| Datasource | This is used ifTypeis set toServer Selection. |\n\n\n#### Data Grid Filtering Examples\n\nThe following tabs contain examples of different types of column filters.\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Symbol starts with | Symbol starts withEURorUSDSymbol starts withEUR, withoutEURAUDSymbol starts withEUR, withoutEURAUDandEURCAD |\n| Symbol ends with | Symbol ends withCAD |\n| Selected numbers/symbols | Selected numbersSelecting Four symbols |\n| Range between | Range between 10000 and 20000000Range between 25 and 75Range outside 25 and 50Return 25 and 50 onlyIgnore null values |\n\nTip\nFiltering variables with !=\nWhen the exclusion function != is used, all values, including column cells with null data, are returned except for the value defined by !=\n\n#### Server selection filtering\n\nServer selection filtering allows users to dynamically filter and interact with large datasets directly from the server, ensuring that only relevant data is retrieved and visualized in the dashboard. This approach is especially useful in scenarios involving real-time data analytics, financial data monitoring, and other data-intensive applications.\nServer selection must be used when data is not fully loaded to the client. For example, when using\nserver-side paging\nor\nServer-side Filtering\nvia the\nKDB Filter String\n.\nServer selection uses a\ndata source\nto return all member items of the filtered column.\nTo define a server-side custom filter:\n- Add a custom filter and setTypetoServer Selection.\n- Define the server-side filter query, as illustrated in the following example, and shown below.CopyselectdistinctMonthfromTradeData\n- View the results and you can see that the filter options in the column header use the server-side filter query you just defined. In the following screenshot, we can see the distinct months being shown.\n\n### Style\n\nThe Style properties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Even Row Background Odd Row Background | Set the background colors of the even and odd rows |\n| Selected Row Background | WhenSelection Modeis set toSingle RoworDouble Rowselection routingproperties this property is used to set the background for the selected row. |\n| Row Height | This sets the height of each of the rows. Here we see two examples with row height set to 30 and 20. |\n| Header Row Height | This sets the height of the header row. |\n| Header Text Transformation | This specifies the text transformation for column headers. The options are;none,uppercase,lowercaseorcapitalize. |\n| Header Font Weight | The font weight for column headers. |\n| Font Family | The font family to be used for column headers and rows. |\n| Font size | The font size to be used for rows (css format). For example,18px,0.8em,80%,larger |\n\nSee\nStyle\nfor details about common style settings.\n\n#### Advanced CSS\n\nSee\nAdvanced CSS\nfor details about using advanced CSS.\n\n### Header Groups\n\nHeader Groups are a set of custom column names that can be defined by the user and added to the column header.\nIn the following example the columns Address Info, Property Info and Price Info are added to a Header Group.\nThese are displayed in the Data Grid shown below.\n\n### Custom Configuration Layout\n\nThe Custom Configuration Layout properties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Ignore Custom Layout Viewstate | When checked, if there is a viewstate defined in thecolumn propertiesthen it ignores this value when applying user defined custom layouts. |\n| Include Hidden Columns | When checked, any hidden columns, (that is any columns with theHiddenproperty checked inColumnproperties)  are included in the list of columns that can be added when applying user defined custom layouts.Custom layouts are applied by clickingConfigurationin preview mode. |\n\n\n### Sparklines\n\nSparklines are small, lightweight charts used to show trends or variations in data. They are useful, when working with data grids, to enhance your data visualization.\nComposite sparklines\nprovide a way of combining sparklines. The following type of Sparklines are supported;\nline\n,\nbar\n,\nstacked bar\n,\npie\n,\ntristate\n,\ndiscrete charts\n,\nbullet graphs\n, and\nbox plots\n.\nThe following screenshot shows a Data Grid component with its columns format set to Sparklines of various types.\nTo display Sparklines:\n- In theBasics propertiesensure the Data Sourceformatis correct.\n- In theColumn properties:Ensure theData Field Namepoints to the correct data in the data source.SetFormattoSparklineModify theSparkline Optionsusing the JSON editor, as displayed below.\nThe\ncommon sparkline options\nsection describes the options used by each of the chart types, with chart specific options described in the following sections:\n- Line charts\n- Bar charts\n- Pie charts\n- Tristate charts\n- Discrete charts\n- Bullet graphs\n- Box plots\n\n#### Sparkline data format\n\nData for Data Grids using Sparklines must be formatted correctly. The examples displayed in this and the following sections use a data source called\nData\n, shown in the following screenshot.\nYou can copy the following kdb+/q query to create this data source query and then create the sample sparklines shown in the following sections.\nq\nCopy\n\n```\n([]Single:{ ((60?30) - 5)}each 1_til 101;Composite: {((20?10);(20?10))}each 1_til 101;XandY: {((1;rand 10);(2;rand 10);(3;rand 10);(4;rand 10);(5;rand 10);(6;rand 10);(7;rand 10);(8;rand 10);(9;rand 10);(10;rand 10);(11;rand 10);(12;rand 10)) }each 1_til 101;Stacked: {((3?10);(3?10);(3?10);(3?10);(3?10);(3?10);(3?10);(3?10);(3?10))}each 1_til 101;Pie:{(3?20)}each 1_til 101;Tristate:{(1- 60?3)}each 1_til 101``)\n```\n\n- ForLine,Bar,Discretecharts,Bullet graphs, andBox plots, the data must be a sequence of numbers separated by semicolons. For example;10; 8; 9; 3; 5; 8; 5. In our example these chart types use Single as theirData Field Name.\n- ForTristatecharts, the data must be a sequence of numbers separated by semicolons, with three values. For example 1, -1, 0 representing win, lose or draw. For example;1; 1; 0; 1; -1; -1; 1; -1; 0; 0; 1; 1. In our example this chart type uses Tristate as itsData Field Name.\n- ForPiecharts, the data is sets of sequences of numbers. Each set (representing an individual pie chart) is made up of numbers separated by semicolons. For example;(1; 1; 2)(20; 50; 80). In our example this chart type uses Pie as itsData Field Name.\n- For stackedBarcharts, values for each data series in the chart can be separated by colons if passed by HTML, or as an array of arrays. For example, to draw series one with values of 1,2,3,4, and series 2 with values of 4,3,2,1 would be passed as((1; 4); (2; 3); (3; 2); (4; 1))\n- ForComposite sparklines, the data must be sets of number sequences each set (per sparkline) in square brackets []. For example;[3, 7, 1, 9, 5, 2, 8, 4, 0, 6, ...], [9, 1, 4, 7, 3, 2, 6, 0, 8, 5, ...]. In our example, this chart type uses Composite as itsData Field Name.\nFor example:\n- The Single query,{ ((60?30) - 5)}each 1_til 101;, calculates the result of subtracting 5 from a random number (between 0 and 29) for each value from 1 to 101, and provides the result as a sequence to display in any column that references it in theirData Field Name.\n- When a column'sFormatis set toSparkline, this sequence of data is displayed in the chart type specified inSparkline Options.The following screenshot shows that for the ColumnLine:TheData Field Nameis set to Single.TheFormatis set toSparkline.TheSparkline Optionsare set up withtype=Line.\nThis results in the data from the query being displayed as Line charts.\n\n#### Common sparkline options\n\nThese options can be set for most of the supported chart types.\nThese options are specified in the JSON editor accessed by clicking\nSparkline Options\nin\ncolumn properties\n. The JSON editor auto-completes names and default values when you enter the initial letters of the name.\n\n| Option | Description | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| type | The following types of chart are supported:Line chartsBar chartsPie chartsTristate chartsDiscrete chartsBullet graphsBox plotsThe common properties for each of these types are described in this table with additional properties described in the sections that follow. | \"line\" |\n| width | The width of the chart. This can be any valid CSS width: 1.5em, 20px, and so on. You have to specify a unit for the number or it won't work. This option does nothing for bar and tristate chars (seebarWidth). | \"auto\" |\n| height | The line height of the containing tag. | \"auto\" |\n| lineColor | This is used byLineandDiscretecharts to specify the color of the line drawn as a CSS values string. | \"#00f\" |\n| fillColor | Specify the color used to fill the area under the graph as a CSS value. Set tofalseto disable fill. | \"#cdf\" |\n| chartRangeMin | Specify the minimum value to use for the range of Y values of the chart. This defaults to the minimum value supplied. | null |\n| chartRangeMax | Specify the maximum value to use for the range of Y values of the chart. This defaults to the maximum value supplied. | null |\n| composite | Setting this totrueensures that any existing chart attached to the tag remains, and a new chart is drawn over it. If an existing chart is detected, the width and height settings are ignored. To ensure the same values align on both charts, you must lock the axis on both charts usingchartRangeMinandchartRangeMax. | false |\n| enableTagOptions | Set totrueif you want options to be specified as attributes on each tag to be transformed into a sparkline, as well as passed to the sparkline() function. See alsotagOptionPrefix. | false |\n| tagOptionPrefix | The string that each option passed as an attribute on a tag must begin with. | \"spark\" |\n| tagValuesAttribute | The name of the tag attribute to fetch values from. | \"values\" |\n| disableHiddenCheck | Set this totrueto disable checking for hidden sparklines. This can be beneficial if you know youâll never attempt to draw a sparkline into a hidden parent element, as it avoids a browser reflow for the test, increasing rendering performance. | false |\n\nThe following screenshot shows the JSON editor with these common options and their default values.\nClick\nApply\nto save the\nSparkline Options\n.\n\n#### Range maps\n\nSeveral parameters, such as\ncolorMap\n, in\nLine charts\nand\ntooltipValueLookups\n, in\ninteractive sparklines\n, accept a range map as a parameter. As the name suggest, it maps ranges of numbers to values. For example:\nJSON\nCopy\n\n```\n{1: \"red\",\"2:9\": \"yellow\",\"10:\": \"red\"}\n```\n\nThis maps 1 to red, values of 2 through 9 (inclusive) to yellow and values of 10 and higher to \"red\"\n\n#### Line charts\n\nA line chart provides a visual representation of data using connected points along a straight line.\nIn addition to the\ncommon options\nthe following options can be applied when the\ntype\nis set to\nline\n.\n\n| Option | Description | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| defaultPixelsPerValue | The number of pixels of width for each value in the chart. | 3 |\n| spotColor | The CSS color of the final value marker. Set tofalseor an empty string to hide it. | \"#f80\" |\n| minSpotColor | The CSS color of the marker displayed for the minimum value. Set this tofalseor an empty string to hide it. | \"#f80\" |\n| maxSpotColor | The CSS color of the marker displayed for the maximum value. Set this tofalseor an empty string to hide it. | \"#f80\" |\n| spotRadius | The radius of all spot markers, in pixels. | 1.5 |\n| valueSpots | Specifies which points to draw spots on, and with which color. Accepts a range. For example, to render green spots on all values less than 50 and red on values higher use{\":49\": \"green\", \"50:\": \"red\"} |  |\n| highlightSpotColor | Specifies a color for the spot that appears on a value when moused over. Set to null to disable. | \"#f5f\" |\n| highlightLineColor | Specifies a color for the vertical line that appears through a value when moused over. Set this to null to disable. | \"#f22\" |\n| lineWidth | The width of the line in pixels. | 1 |\n| normalRangeMin,normalRangeMax | Specify the threshold values between which to draw a bar to denote the normal or expected range of values. For example, the green bar might denote a normal operating temperature range. | \"null\" |\n| drawNormalOnTop | Setting this option totruecauses the normal range to be drawn over the top of the fill area. When set to false the normal range is drawn behind the fill area of the chart. | false |\n| xvalues | By default the values supplied to line charts are presumed to be y values mapping on to sequential (integer) X values. If you need to specify both the X and Y values for your chart, use an array of arrays:((1; 3); (2; 4); (5; 3))You can also specify a value ofnullto omit values from the chart completely. |  |\n| chartRangeClip | When set totruethe Y values supplied to plot are clipped to fall betweenchartRangeMinandchartRangeMax. | By defaultchartRangeMin/Maxjust ensures that the chart spans at least that range of values, but does not constrain it. |\n| chartRangeMinX | Specifies the minimum X value of the chart | null |\n| chartRangeMaxX | Specifies the maximum X value of the chart | null |\n\nThe following screenshot shows the JSON editor with these line specific properties and their default values.\n\n#### Bar charts\n\nA bar chart provides a visual representation of data using rectangular bars.\nIn addition to the\ncommon options\nthe following options can be applied when the\ntype\nis set to\nbar\n.\nValues can be omitted by using the\nnull\nvalue instead of a number.\n\n| Option | Description | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| barColor | The CSS color used for positive values. | \"#3366cc\" |\n| negBarColor | The CSS color used for negative values. | \"#f44\" |\n| zeroColor | The CSS color used for values equal to zero. | null |\n| nullColor | The CSS color used for values equal to null. When this is set to null, null values are omitted entirely, but setting this adds a thin marker for the entry. This can be useful if your chart has minimal data points. Try setting it to a light gray or something equally unobtrusive. | null |\n| barWidth | The width of each bar, in pixels (integer). | 4 |\n| barSpacing | The space between each bar, in pixels (integer). | 1 |\n| zeroAxis | This centers the Y-axis at zero if true. | true |\n| colorMap | Arange mapto map specific values to selected colors. For example if you want all values of -2 to appear yellow, usecolorMap: { \"-2\": \"#ff0\" }. You may also pass an array of values here instead of a mapping to specify a color for each individual bar. For example if your chart has three values 1, 3, 1 you can setcolorMap=[\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"] |  |\n| stackedBarColor | An array of colors to use for stacked bar charts. The first series uses the first value in the array, the second series uses the second, and so on. | \"#3366cc\"\"#dc3912\"\"#ff9900\"\"#109618\"\"#66aa00\"\"#dd4477\"\"#0099c6\"\"#990099\" |\n\nThe following screenshot shows the JSON editor with these bar chart specific properties and their default values.\nTo create stacked bar charts, values for each data series in the chart can be separated by colons if passed by HTML, or as an array of arrays.\nFor example, to draw series one with values of 1,2,3,4, and series 2 with values of 4,3,2,1:\n((1; 4); (2; 3); (3; 2); (4; 1))\n\n#### Tristate charts\n\nTristate charts are useful to show win-lose-draw information, such as the SF Giants recent game results below. You can also use the\ncolorMap\noption to use different colors for different values, or for arbitrary positions in the chart.\nIn addition to the\ncommon options\nthe following options can be applied when the\ntype\nis set to\ntristate\n.\n\n| Option | Description | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| posBarColor | The CSS color for positive (win) values. | \"#6f6\" |\n| negBarColor | The CSS color for negative (lose) values. | \"#f44\" |\n| zeroBarColor | The CSS color for zero (draw) values. | \"#999\" |\n| barWidth | The width of each bar, in pixels (integer). | 4 |\n| barSpacing | The space between each bar, in pixels (integer). | 1 |\n| colorMap | Arange mapto map specific values to selected colors. For example if you want all values of -2 to appear yellow, usecolorMap: { \"-2\": \"#ff0\" }.You may also pass an array of values here instead of a mapping to specifiy a color for each individual bar. For example if your chart has three values 1, 3, 1 you can setcolorMap[\"red\", \"green\", \"blue\"]. |  |\n\nThe following screenshot shows the JSON editor with these tristate chart specific options and their default values.\n\n#### Discrete charts\n\nDiscrete charts provide a separated thin vertical line for each value.\nIn addition to the\ncommon options\nthe following options can be applied when the\ntype\nis set to\ndiscrete\n.\n\n| Option | Description | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| lineHeight | The height of each line in pixels. | \"auto\"= 30% of the graph height |\n| thresholdValue | Values less than this value are drawn usingthresholdColorinstead oflineColor | 0 |\n| thresholdColor | The color to use in combination withthresholdvalue. | null |\n\nThe following screenshot shows the JSON editor with these discrete chart specific options and their default values.\n\n#### Bullet graphs\n\nA\nbullet graph\nis a variation of a bar graph. Inspired by the traditional thermometer charts and progress bars found in many dashboards, the bullet graph serves as a replacement for dashboard gauges and meters.\nIn addition to the\ncommon options\nthe following options can be applied when the\ntype\nis set to\nbullet\n.\nSupplied values must be in this order: target, performance, range 1, range 2, range 3, â¦\n\n| Option | Description | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| targetColor | The CSS color of the vertical target marker. | \"#f33\" |\n| targetWidth | The width of the target marker in pixels (integer). | 3 |\n| performanceColor | The CSS color of the performance measure horizontal bar | #f33 |\n| rangeColors | The colors to use for each qualitativerange background color.

Omit the outliers and setshowOutlierstofalseto omit outlier display. |\n| showOutliers | Outliers are values that are numerically distant from the rest of the data. When set totrueoutliers (values > 1.5 Ã the IQR) are marked with circles and the whiskers are placed at Q1 and Q3 instead of the least and greatest value. | true |\n| outlierIQR | This sets the inter-quartile range multiplier used to calculate values that qualify as an outlier. | 1.5 |\n| boxLineColor | The CSS line color used to outline the box. | \"#000\" |\n| boxFillColor | The CSS fill color used for the box. | \"#cdf\" |\n| whiskerColor | The CSS color used to draw the whiskers. | \"#000\" |\n| outlierLineColor | The CSS color used to draw the outlier circles. | \"#333\" |\n| outlierFillColor | The CSS color used to fill the outlier circles. | \"#fff\" |\n| spotRadius | The radius in pixels to draw the outlier circles. | 1.5 |\n| medianColor | The CSS color used to draw the median line. | \"#f00\" |\n| target | If set to a value, then a small crosshair is drawn at that point to represent a target value. | null |\n| targetColor | The CSS color used to draw the target crosshair. | null |\n| minValue | Ifminvalueandmaxvalueare set then the scale of the plot is fixed. By defaultminValueandmaxValueare deduced from the values supplied. | **** |\n| maxValue | SeeminValue. | **** |\n\nThe following screenshot shows the JSON editor with these box plots specific options and their default values.\n\n#### Composite sparklines\n\nA composite sparkline combines multiple individual sparklines into a single chart. This helps you to compare trends or variations across different data sets.\nThe screenshot above uses the following JSON to display the data in a bar and a line chart.\nJSON\nCopy\n\n```\n[{\"type\": \"bar\",\"composite\": false, \"height\": \"29px\",\"width\": \"100%\"},{\"type\": \"line\",\"composite\": true,\"fillColor\": \"rgba(0,255,0, 0.2)\",\"lineColor\": \"#00ff00\",\"height\": \"29px\",\"width\": \"100%\"}]\n```\n\n\n#### Interactive sparklines\n\nInteractive sparklines in the form of tooltips, mouseover highlighting, and click interaction are supported for all types of sparkline.\nIn Preview mode, the example above maps numerical values to months. So a value of 4-4 is displayed as Apr 4.\nNote\nIf youâre happy with the default look and feel of the tooltips, you can skip this entire section.\nThe following options, used to control sparkline interactions, can be specified in the JSON editor for\nSparkline Option\nwhen the\nFormat\nis set to\nSparkline\nin\nColumn properties\n:\n\n| Option | Description | Default value |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| disableInteraction | Set totrueto disable all sparkline interactivity. | false |\n| disableTooltips | Set totrueto disable mouseover tooltips. | false |\n| disableHighlight | Set totrueto disable the highlighting of individual values when mousing over a sparkline. | false |\n| highlightLighten | Controls the amount to lighten or darken a value when moused over.

By using text matching or regular expressions (regex), you can set visual styling or behaviors without needing to configure each column individually. This makes it easy to visually distinguish column based on names or other text.\nThere are four\nOverride Rules\n, described below. The properties displayed vary depending on the rule you select.\n- Rules are evaluated at render-time.\n- If multiple rules apply to a column, the last one is applied.\nColumn Rule Boolean\nColumn Rule String\nColumn Rule Number\nColumn Rule Color\nThe\nBoolean Rule\nenables conditional styling based on text or categorical values in a column. The rule properties are defined in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rule Name | Enter a name for the rule. |\n| Rule Source | Select the name of the column property source.It can be :UserDefinedSortableHideTrailingZeroesHighlightChangesIsReadonlyIsSelectableShowArrowsOnChangeIsRangeHighlightColorInvertedHiddenFilter |\n| Rule Target (Column Name | Select the column that the rule targets, or enter a regular expression or wildcard in the data entry field, then clickAdd Custom Column. |\n| Rule Value | The value to be applied to the source. |\n\nThe\nString Rule\nenables conditional styling based on text or categorical values in a column. The rule properties are defined in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rule Name | Enter a name for the rule. |\n| Rule Source | Select the name of the column property source.It can be:DisplayNameTooltipTextAlignFormatHideTrailingZeroesCurrencyDateFormatTimeFormatTemplateSparklineOptionsFooterFooterWeightsHeader |\n| Rule Target (Column Name) | Select the layer that the rule targets, or enter a regular expression or wildcard in the data entry field, then clickAdd Custom Layer. |\n| Rule Value | The value to be applied to the source. |\n\nThe\nNumber Rule\nenables conditional styling based on text or categorical values in a column.

In WebGL2 a combination of vertex shaders (position) and fragment shaders (color) are used to render data points providing the capability to display millions of data points in milliseconds.\nMultiple large data sources can be plotted on the same chart with high speed and performance using\nlayers\n. The following screenshot shows an example of historic FX data plotted using four layers.\nNote\nOvercoming browser WebGL limits\nEach ChartGL uses its own WebGL context. Browsers limit the number of active WebGL contexts, so when this limit is reached, charts can fail to load. To combat this issue we recommend adding ChartGL components to the\nLayout Panel\ncomponent and setting\nEnable WebGL Context\nfor the layout panel. When this is enabled, every ChartGL, that is added directly to the Layout Panel, shares a single WebGL context, meaning the user can have an unlimited number of charts.\nThis page provides information on the following:\n- Setting up a ChartGL component\n- ChartGL properties\n\n## Set up a ChartGL component\n\nTo set up a ChartGL component, click and drag the component into the workspace and configure the following:\n- Click to populate Data Sourceor select aData Sourcefrom theLayers propertiesto open the Data dialog. Click New and proceed with configuring theData Source.ChartGL best fits your data to the chart using a wild card selector in Y-Axis Data. Otherwise, select your data to plot forX-Axis DataandY-Axis Datain theLayers properties. Alternatively, format your axes in the relevant properties for each;x-axisandy-axis\n- Next define the properties as defined in the following sections.\n\n## ChartGL properties\n\nThe following sections provides details on how to configure the properties of the ChartGL component.\n\n### Basics\n\nOpen the Basics properties on the right and configure the properties described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Name | Enter a name for the component. |\n| Hover | Enter aView State Parameterwhich stores the x-axis value contingent on where the hover bar is on the chart. For example time or date. |\n| Selected | Enter aView State Parameterto store the x-axis value at the selected position. For example time or date. |\n| Selected First Point | Use this option to allow for the first time in the first layer to be selected when the chart loads.When checked, and when theSelectedproperty is set to a viewstate, it sets the Selected viewstate value to be the first point in the first layer on initial chart load.This is unchecked by default. |\n| Range Selection | When this is enabled the user can click and drag on a chart as normal, but instead of zooming, it stores the x-axis range values. The values can be accessed by assigning view states to theSelection Min&Selection Maxproperties on the x-axes. It turns the chart into a selector that stores the values in the x-axisSelection MinandSelection Maxview state properties.When this is enabled, it overrides theZoomcheckbox. If both are left unchecked, the chart does not zoom or use the range selection. |\n| Zoom | Check to enable/disable zoom. This feature makes it possible to zoom on a region within both x and y axis, or individually on each x or y axis. Double-Clicking the chart resets the chart to its initial state.Mouse scroll can be used for x-axis zoom, with mouse scroll + shift key for y-axis zoom. |\n| Animation Duration | Define the zoom animation and length of time in milliseconds to complete. |\n| Animation Easing | This drop-down list of options are used to control how the zoom animation transitions. For example bounce creates a spring like effect. There are a number of options for you to try. |\n| The Pan feature lets you pan along one axis at a time. To pan, click and drag from anywhere on the axis. Double-clicking the chart resets the chart to its initial state. |\n| Track Load Time | Enable this to set theLoad Time (ms)value. |\n| Load Time (ms) | Use this to set aView State Parameterused to track the load time of the chart, in milliseconds, on each update of the data. This is useful for tracking the performance of the chart to see how long it takes to load. WhenTrack Load Timeis enabled, andLoad Time (ms)has a view state set, it writes the time in ms into the view state. This view state value can then be displayed in a text component, as shown in the Chart Load Time on the following chart. |\n| Add Patterns to Bars | This can be used to improve accessibility and visual distinction by adding patterns to bars.When checked, patters are added to bars so that users do not have to rely solely on color to distinguish between the bars.When unchecked, bars use solid colors.The following illustrates how adding patterns to bars make it easier for someone withto distinguish the individual bars in the chart. |\n| Inherit Hierarchical Rules | When this is checked the ChartGL component inheritsHierarchical Rules set for the Dashboard.However when set, the chartsOverride Rulesoverride any Dashboard level Hierarchical Rules. |\n\n\n### Layers\n\nLayers provide the ability to display multiple different data sources on the same chart. In the following example four layers have been defined;\nCandlestick\n,\nBar\n,\nLine\n, and\nBubble\n.\nTo add a Layer, click\nLayers\nand\nLayer 1\nto open the properties for the first layer.\nSelect a layer type from the dropdown. The properties displayed vary depending on the option selected. Click on the relevant tab, in the note section below, to view the properties for each type of layer.\nBubble\nLine\nBar\nWaterfall\nBounds\nCandlestick\nHeatmap\nBaseline\nBubble layers display data as individual points.\nDefine the following\n- General layer properties\n- Color Palette\n- Bubbles\n- Actions\n- Highlight Rules\n- Labels\nLine layers connect each data point resulting in a continuous line.\nDefine the following properties:\n- General layer properties\n- Color Palette\n- Candlestick Format\n- Actions\n- Highlight Rules\n- Labels\nBar layers display data as bars.\nDefine the following properties:\n- General layer properties\n- Color Palette\n- Actions\n- Highlight Rules\n- Labels\nWaterfall layers display data as increase and decrease bars.\nDefine the following properties:\n- General layer properties\n- Color Palette\n- Actions\n- Highlight Rules\n- Labels\nBounds layers draw a bounding area between two points.\nDefine the following properties:\n- General layer properties\n- Color Palette\n- Actions\n- Highlight Rules\n- Labels\nCandlestick layers display data as candlesticks.\nDefine the following properties:\n- General layer properties\n- Color Palette\n- Candlestick\n- Actions\n- Highlight Rules\n- Labels\nHeatmap layers draw a heatmap chart.\nDefine the following properties:\n- General layer properties\n- Color Palette\n- Actions\n- Highlight Rules\n- Labels\nBaseline layers draw a line at a single point.\nDefine the following properties:\n- General layer properties\n- Labels\n\n#### General layer properties\n\nThe following properties are relevant to all layer types, unless otherwise stated.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Data Source | Specify theData sourcesto be used for the layer. This is not relevant to Baseline layers as they useBaseline Value/Baseline Axisto specify where the Baseline is drawn. |\n| Name | Enter a name for the chart legend label. |\n| X-Axis | Select the x-axis from the definedAxes. |\n| Y-Axis | Select the y-axis from the definedAxes. |\n| X-Axis Data | Select data columns to plot X-Axis data from the data source. |\n| Y Axis Data | Select data columns to plot Y Axis data from the data source.Y Axisincludes a wildcard selection (*) for multiple columns. Wildcard selection uses columns of the most common, single kdb type. For example, if a data set has onedatetype column, threeintegertype columns, and fivefloattype columns, only the fivefloatcolumns are plotted using the wildcard. Theintegeranddatecolumns are ignored.Regular expressions can also be used to define the y-axis.When a wildcard or regular expression is used, theColor Palettedefines point color for each added column. The following kdb data types are supported; byte, char, date, datetime, float, int, long, minute, month, real, second, short, string, symbol, time, timespan, and timestamp. |\n| Multi X-Axis | Add multiple x-axis groups by selecting one or more columns to populate the multiple x-axes, without affecting the datapoints shown. Each column is a separate x-axis, grouping values together. You can format the axis settings on the layer's linked x-axis underMulti Axis Format.An example of multi x-axis groups is shown in the image below. This displays two charts: the top one showing two levels of multi axis grouping, and the bottom shows three levels. For the bottom chart, the x-axis is populated with the columngrp1, and the multi axis grouping is populated with the columnsgrp2andgrp3, which each display an x-axis. Each unique value in the column is seen as a group, so it displays one label for each unique value. For example, in the bottom chart, thegrp3axis is split into two groups: Jan and Oct.The query below is used in the above example: |\n| Open/High/Low/Close | These properties apply only to Candlestick layers. Select the data columns that correspond to the open, high, low, and close price points. |\n| X1 Coordinate | This is only relevant for Heatmap layers. Select the data column that corresponds to the X1 coordinate. |\n| X2 Coordinate | This is only relevant for Heatmap layers. Select the data column that corresponds to the X2 coordinate. |\n| Y1 Coordinate | This is only relevant for Heatmap layers. Select the data column that corresponds to the Y1 coordinate. |\n| Y2 Coordinate | This is only relevant for Heatmap layers. Select the data column that corresponds to the Y2 coordinate. |\n| Score | This is only relevant for Heatmap layers. Select the data columns that correspond to each. Colors are defined by the Score column, which uses theColor Palette. |\n| Color | Select color for single plot (non-wildcard/regex) data sets. |\n| Opacity | Define the opacity of the points from a value between 0 (transparent) and 100 (opaque). |\n| Bar Percentage | This is only relevant for Bar layers and defines the bar width as a percentage of its range whenBar Percentageis selected fromBar Width Type. |\n| Bar Fixed Width | This is only relevant for Bar layers. It defines the bar width as a fixed value whenFixed Widthis selected fromBar Width Type. |\n| Bar Width Type | This is only relevant for Bar layers. Use the dropdown to select eitherBar PercentageorFixed Width. |\n| Bar Orientation | This is only relevant for Bar layers. Use the dropdown to select eitherVerticalandHorizontal. |\n| Bar Increase Color | This is only relevant for Bar layers and is used when the layer type isWaterfallto define the visual style of the Waterfall bar increase colors based on the previous bar value. |\n| Bar Decrease Color | This is only relevant for Bar layers and is used when the layer type isWaterfallto define the visual style of the Waterfall bar decrease colors based on the previous bar value. |\n| x1 | This is used when the layer type isBounds, to define the x1 coordinates of the bounding region. |\n| x2 | This is used when the layer type isBounds, to define the x2 coordinates of the bounding region. |\n| Baseline Axis | This is used when the layer type isBaseline, to define the axis at which to draw the baseline, based on theBaseline Value. |\n| Baseline Value | This is used when the layer type isBaseline, to define the value at which to draw the baseline. The axis on which this is draw in set inBaseline Axis. This is used in place of aData Source. |\n| Legend Group (Custom) | Use this dropdown to assign the layer legend to aLegend Group |\n| Legend Color by Column | Select a data column to apply color. When a column is selected, theColor Palettedefines point color for each unique value in the column. This is not applicable to Baseline layers. |\n| Show Current Tick Label | Enable this to display the last tick in the series on the y-axis. |\n| Cache Streaming Data | Enable this when using streaming data to improve performance by caching data. |\n| Legend Enabled | Use this to toggle the display of the data legend. |\n| Enabled | Use this to toggle the display of the data layer on the chart and can be tied to aview state parameter. |\n\n\n#### Bubbles\n\nThe following additional properties are configurable when the layer type is\nBubble\nor\nLine\n.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Radius Data | This dropdown gives options to set the variable point size for the bubbles. Select eitherFixed Sizeor one of the columns from the associated data source. |\n| Radius Scaling | Define the bubble size. |\n| Scale on Zoom | Increase the bubble size on zoom. |\n| Set Icon from Data | Check this to assign different icons and colors to bubbles based on their data source. This visual differentiation allows viewers to quickly identify and distinguish between multiple data layers or origins within the same chart. It is particularly useful when overlaying several datasets for comparison or correlation.WhenSet Icon from Datais enabled, theIconproperty changes to a dropdown and theIcon Colorproperty is displayed.When icons are taken form the data source they must be specified as shown in the following example:icon:(\"fa-caret-up\";\"fa-caret-down\";fa-caret-up\");: Wherefa-xxxindicates a font awesome icon. Alternatively you can use a base-64 encoded image string.iconColor:(\"green\";\"red\";\"green\") |\n| Icon | Use the icon selector to choose an icon to be displayed in the position of the data points on the chart.WhenSet Icon from Datais unchecked, the following dialog appears allowing you to select the icon image manually.Icons also support a base64 image in aview state parameter.WhenSet Icon from Datais enabled, this property changes to a dropdown with a list of columns from your datasource. Select the column representing the icon to be used.NoteSince ChartGL does not support point styles, you must use either Font Awesome icons or base64-encoded images for point customization. |\n| Icon Color | Set the color of bubbles when using aLineorBubblelayer that hasSet Icon from Dataenabled. Select the data source column to be used for the color of the icon. |\n| Color | Set the color of bubbles when using aLinelayer.WhenSet Icon from Datais enabled, empty values in theIcon Colorare filled with the color specified here. |\n| Opacity | Set opacity of bubbles when using aLinelayer. |\n\n\n#### Candlestick\n\nThe following additional properties are configurable when the layer type is\nCandlestick\n.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bear Color | Set the color for down day candles. |\n| Bull Color | Set the color for up day candles. |\n| Neutral Color | Set the color for flat days. |\n| Bar Percentage | Define the candlestick body width as a percentage of its range whenBar Percentageis selected underBar Width Type. |\n| Bar Fixed Width | Define the candlestick body width as a fixed value whenFixed Widthis selected underBar Width Type. |\n| Bar Width Type | Use the dropdown to select eitherBar PercentageorFixed Width. |\n| Bar Orientation | Use the dropdown to select eitherVerticalorHorizontal. |\n\n\n#### Line\n\nThe following additional properties are configurable when the layer type is\nLine\n.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Line Width | Set the thickness of the line. |\n| Line Style | Choose betweenNone,Dashed,Dotted. |\n| Dash Gap | WhenLine StyleisDottedorDashed, set the size of the gaps. |\n| Dash Width | WhenLine StyleisDashed, set the width of the dashes. |\n| Fill | Select a fill option:No Fill- No color fillLayer n- For color fill between the charted line and the selected layer. This option is only shown if there is more than one layer.Origin- For color fill between the chart line and X-axis |\n| Fill Color | The color to be used for line fill for single plot (non-wildcard/regex) data sets. |\n| Fill Opacity | The opacity used for line fill. |\n| Fade to Transparent | Where a line fill color is employed, a transparency gradient is applied to the layer. |\n| Span Gaps | Where there is missing data, check this to connect isolated points. |\n| Palette Theme | Define thePalette Themefor theFill Palette |\n\n\n#### Fill Palette\n\nThis sets the line fill colors for wildcard/regex y-axis or Legend Color by Column. See\nPalette\nfor further details.\n\n#### Interpolation\n\nInterpolation lets you estimate a value between two known values explicitly stated in a line graph. You can specify the following interpolation properties.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Interpolation | Choose between the following types of interpolation:Linear- connects data points with straight lines.Stepped- assumes that the function remains constant between adjacent data points. It creates a step-like curve where the value jumps from one data point to the next without any intermediate values.Monotone- the interpolated curve maintains monotonicity (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing) between data points. Monotone Interpolation comes with a performance caveat, so isn't suitable for streaming. |\n| Stepped Line | Use this to switch between stepped line chart types;BeforeandAfter. |\n| Curvature | Set the level of curve to use forMonotoneline charts. |\n\n\n#### Color Palette\n\nThe Color Palette sets plot point colors for wildcard/regex y-axis or Legend Color by Column. See\nPalettes\nfor further details.\n\n#### Bars\n\nThe following additional properties are configurable when the layer type is\nBar\nor\nWaterfall\n.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Bar Percentage | Defines the bar width as a percentage of its range whenBar Percentageis selected fromBar Width Type. |\n| Bar Fixed Width | This defines the bar width as a fixed value whenFixed Widthis selected fromBar Width Type. |\n| Bar Width Type | Use the dropdown to select eitherBar PercentageorFixed Width. |\n| Bar Orientation | Use the dropdown to select eitherVerticalorHorizontal. |\n| Border Width | SettingBorder Widthto a value greater than zero enables borders on bars. You can also set the opacity and color of these borders.These properties improve visual clarity by helping distinguish adjacent bars, while offering flexibility to adapt the chartâs appearance to your needs.The screenshot below shows bar charts with borders applied, and highlights the configurable border properties. |\n| Border Opacity |\n| Border Color |\n\n\n#### Actions\n\nSee\nActions\nfor full details.\n\n#### Highlight rules\n\nSee\nHighlight Rules\nfor full details.\n\n#### Labels\n\nData labels can be added to any layers. They are placed next to datapoints/bars as desired.\nThe label properties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Enabled | Turn on or off data labels. This can be tied to aview state. |\n| Label Color | Set the color of the Label text. |\n| Label Freq | Labels are applied to every nth data point where n is value set here. |\n| Align | Choose the position label; top, bottom, left, right, or center of the data point. |\n| Offset | The offset represents the distance (in pixels) to pull the label away from the data point. This can be specified as a single number (for example 4) or an x,y coordinate (for example 4,10). |\n| Rotation | Set the clockwise rotation angle (in degrees) of the label with the rotation center point being the label center. The default value is 0 (no rotation) |\n| Max Label Quantity | The max number of labels to draw. The default value is 10. |\n| Label Template | Define the data to display. This must return a string; HTML is not supported. Select the data to display with theTemplate Editorin either Basic or Advanced mode. Existing data and view states can be displayed. Handlebar helpers can be used for formats. |\n| Font | Set the font settings:Bold- check to make the label boldSize- adjust the font size in pixels. |\n\n\n### X-Axes\n\nChartGL supports multiple X-axes. This is useful if you want, for example, to compare different scales, overlay data series, represent different time zones or different geographic coordinates. There is no limit on the number of x-axes that can be added.\nThe following screenshot shows a ChartGL with 3 x-axes defined; 2 on the bottom of the chart and one on top.\nFor each x-axis you can define the following properties:\n- General x-axis properties\n- Range properties\n- Gridlines properties\n- Format properties\n- Title properties\n\n#### X-Axis General Properties\n\nThe general x-axis properties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| X-Axis Type | Choose between,Line,Linear,Category,TimeorLogarithmicdata. |\n| Position | Select whether you want to position the axis to thetoporbottomof the chart. |\n| Height | Set the height of the tick area of the x-axis in pixels. |\n| Tick Spacing | When theX-Axis Typeis set toTime, you can specify the type of tick spacing as either:Number of TicksorFixed Tick Interval (ms)The next field displayed depends on the option selected. |\n| Number of Ticks | Set the number of ticks to display in the axis. The default is 10. |\n| Fixed Tick Interval (ms) | Set the interval between ticks in milliseconds. For example an interval of 1800000 results in 30 min tick intervals on the x-axis. |\n| Color | Select the color of the axis. |\n| Filter Unique | Displayed when the Axis Type is set to Category. When using non-linear data (string/symbol), some values may be the same. Filter unique is used for grouping same values together. For example, a data source might have 'b' and 'b' in it twice. If filter unique is enabled, it groups points for 'b' as having the same x-axis value. If disabled it shows values at different points.In the following example the ChartGL named Layer1 hasFilter Uniqueticked and so only shows unique values. The second chart hasn't been set toFilter Uniqueand so the same value is displayed more than once. |\n| Sort | Displayed when the Axis Type is set to Category. When checked, the axis data is sorted. Strings are sorted alphabetically. This is unchecked by default. |\n| Stacked | When using a Bar Chart, check this to have the bars stacked. |\n\n\n#### X-Axis Range\n\nThe x-axis range properties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Use Min/Max | Enable the use ofMinandMaxto build the x-axis. If these are unchecked theMinandMaxvalues, set below, are ignored. |\n| Min | Define the minimum value for the x-axis. |\n| Max | Define the maximum values for the x-axis. Charted data outside of the setMinandMaxrange is not displayed. If all data falls outside the set range, the chart is blank. |\n| Selection Min | Pull min x-axis values on a zoom select into the assignedview state parameters. |\n| Selection Max | Pull max x-axis values on a zoom select into the assignedview state parameters. |\n\n\n#### X-Axis Gridlines\n\nThe x-axis gridline properties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Offset GridLines | Enable to align x-axis grid lines to the mid-point between tick values. |\n| GridLines Color | Define the color of x-axis grid lines. |\n| GridLines Opacity | Define the opacity (0 (transparent) to 100 (opaque)) of x-axis grid lines. |\n\n\n#### X-Axis Format\n\nThe x-axis format properties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Display | Toggles the display of x-axis. |\n| Rotation | Set the clockwise rotation angle (in degrees) of the label. The default value is 0 (no rotation) |\n| Begin at Zero | When enabled, the axis data starts at zero. |\n| Hide Trailing Zeroes | Hides the display of trailing zeroes in x-axis tick values. |\n| Numeric Format | Sets the x-axis format as eitherNumber,Smart Number,Formatted Number. For example 1000, 1K, 1,000. |\n| Date/Time Format | Select the x-axis date/time format from the options in the drop-down list, including;YYYY-MM-DD,YYYY-MMM-DD,YYYY-MM,YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ssand more. |\n| Decimal Places | Sets the precision point for x-axis numeric labels. |\n| Font Size | Sets the tick font size in pixels. |\n| Prefix | Adds text to the start of tick label; for example currency or percentage symbol. |\n| Suffix | Adds text to the end tick label; for example currency or percentage symbol. |\n| Distribution | Distribution,Break, andTrigger Breakfields are all related and are only displayed when theX-Axis Typeis set toTime. They are used when a chart, with time related data, has a break in the data, for example over a weekend when no new data comes in. This setting is used to shorten the length of the display of this empty data so there isn't a big gap shown. The options areLinearorSmart. If linear is chosen it remains as is. If Smart is selected the following two properties are used. |\n| Break | WhenDistributionis set toSmart, use this to define the duration of time in milliseconds at which to break. That is, the space in ms between the two data points you want to shorten: pointB - pointA. |\n| TriggerBreak | WhenDistributionis set toSmart, use this to define the new duration, in milliseconds from the start point; newPointB = pointA + Trigger Break (ms). |\n| Show Major Units | Used when theX-Axis Typeis set toTime. When enabled, major ticks are generated. Each major tick represents a new parent time (based on the child minor ticks). Minor ticks are shown by default. |\n| Multi Axis Format | If the layer hasMulti X-Axisset, customize theRotation,Font Size,PrefixandSuffixfor each axis. |\n\n\n#### X-Axis Title\n\nThe x-axis title properties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Display | Enables the display of the x-axis label. |\n| Label String | Defines x-axes label text. |\n| Font Size | Sets the label font size in pixels. |\n\n\n### Y-Axes\n\nChartGL supports multiple Y-axes. This is useful when you are dealing with data that varies significantly in value ranges. Multi-axes charts allow you to plot multiple data sets with different units. You can either create separate y-axes for each scale or include multiple series on the same scale. There is no limit on the number of y-axes that can be added.\nThe following screenshot shows a ChartGL with 2 y-axes defined; one on the left and one on the right.\nFor each y-axis you can define the following properties:\n- General y-axes properties\n- Range properties\n- Gridlines properties\n- Format properties\n- Title properties\n\n#### Y-Axis General Properties\n\nSet the general y-axis properties described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Y-Axis Type | Choose betweenLinear,Category,Time, orLogaritmicdata. |\n| Position | Set the position of the axis to theLeftorRightof the chart. |\n| Height | Sets the width of the tick area of the y-axis in pixels. |\n| Tick Spacing | When theY-Axis Typeis set toTime, you can specify the type of tick spacing as either:Number of TicksorFixed Tick Interval (ms).The next field displayed depends on the option selected. |\n| Number of Ticks | Set the number of ticks to display in the axis. The default is 10. |\n| Fixed Tick Interval (ms) | Set the interval between ticks in milliseconds. For example an interval of 1800000 results in 30 min tick intervals on the y-axis. |\n| Color | Select the color of the axis. |\n| Filter Unique | Displayed when the Axis Type is set to Category. When using non-linear data (string/symbol), some values may be the same. Filter unique is used for grouping same values together. For example a data source might have 'b' and 'b' in it twice. If filter unique is enabled, it groups points for 'b' as having the same y-axis value. If disabled it shows values at different points.In the following example the ChartGL named Layer1 hasFilter Uniqueticked and so only shows unique values. The second chart hasn't been set toFilter Uniqueand so the same value is displayed more than once. |\n| Sort | Displayed when the Axis Type is set to Category. When enabled, sorts the data. If using strings, sort alphabetically. |\n| Stacked | When using a Bar chart, check this to have the bars stacked. |\n\n\n#### Y-Axis Range\n\nConfigure the following y-axis range properties.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Use Min/Max | Enables the use ofMinandMaxto build y-axis. |\n| Min | Defines the minimum value for the y-axis. |\n| Max | Defines the maximum values for the y-axis. Charted data outside of the setMinandMaxrange is not displayed. If all data falls outside the set range, the chart is blank. |\n| Selection Min | Pulls min y-axis values on a zoom select into assignedview state parameters. |\n| Selection Max | Pulls max y-axis values on a zoom select into assignedview state parameters. |\n\n\n#### Y-Axis Gridlines\n\nConfigure the following y-axis gridlines properties.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Offset GridLines | Enables the alignment of y-axis grid lines to the mid-point between tick values. |\n| GridLines Color | Defines the color of y-axis grid lines. |\n| GridLines Opacity | Defines the opacity for y-axis grid lines. The range is between 0 (transparent) and 100 (opaque). |\n\n\n#### Y-Axis Format\n\nConfigure the following y-axis format properties.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Display | Toggles the display of y-axis. |\n| Rotation | Set the clockwise rotation angle (in degrees) of the label. The default value is 0 (no rotation) |\n| Begin at Zero | When enabled, the axis data starts at zero. |\n| Hide Trailing Zeroes | Hides the display of trailing zeroes in y-axis tick values. |\n| Numeric Format | Sets the y-axis format as eitherNumber,Smart Number, orFormatted Number. For example 1000, 1K, 1,000. |\n| Decimal Places | Sets the precision point for y-axis numeric labels. |\n| Font Size | Sets the tick font size in pixels. |\n| Prefix | Adds text to the start of tick label; for example currency or percentage symbol. |\n| Suffix | Adds text to the end tick label; for example currency or percentage symbol. |\n| Distribution | Distribution,Break, andTrigger Breakare all related and are only displayed when theY-Axis Typeis set toTime. They are used when a chart, with time related data, has a break in the data, for example over a weekend when no new data comes in. This setting is used to shorten the length of the display of this empty data so there isn't a big gap shown.The options are:Linear- If linear is chosen it remains as is.Smart- If Smart is selected the following two properties are used. |\n| Break | This defines the duration of time in milliseconds at which to break at. That is, the space in ms between the two data points you want to shorten: pointB - pointA. |\n| TriggerBreak | This defines the new duration, in milliseconds from the start point; newPointB = pointA + Trigger Break (ms). |\n| Show Major Units | Used when theY-Axis Typeis set toTime. When enabled, major ticks are generated. Each major tick represents a new parent time (based on the child minor ticks). Minor ticks are shown by default. |\n\n\n#### Y-Axis Title\n\nThe y-axis title properties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Display | Check to enable the display of y-axis label. |\n| Label String | Defines the y-axis label text. |\n| Font Size | Sets the label font size in pixels. |\n\n\n### Overlay\n\nThe Overlay properties define elements that are drawn on top of the chart on hover. This includes tooltips, crosshairs, and coordinates. In the following example, the mouse is hovering on the chart and shows all 3 of these elements.\n- The tooltip contains the x and y data from the hovered point.\n- The crosshair shows a horizontal and vertical dashed line on the current data position.\n- The coordinates are on the x and y axes, showing the respective current hovered value at its position on the axis.\nThe Overlay properties, shown in the following screenshot are defined in the table below.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Show Crosshairs | When this is enabled crosshairs are shown on the chart. |\n| Show Coordinates | When this is enabled coordinates are shown on chart. |\n| Snap Crosshair to Data | When this is enabled crosshairs and coordinates move to the nearest valid point on hover. |\n| Use custom tooltip | When this is enabled theCustom tooltipis enabled. |\n| Custom tooltip | Defines a custom tooltip. SeeCustom tooltipsfor details. |\n| Show all layers | When checked, shows all layers in the tooltip. Otherwise, only shows the hovered layer. |\n| Show all data points | Displays all y-axis values for selected point on the x-axis. |\n| Group tooltip by layer | WhenShow all data pointsis enabled this displays data points in a distinct column for each Layer instead of a continuous list. |\n\n\n### Legend\n\nYou can add legends to represent different data series or categories within the chart. These can be grouped into\nlegend groups\nwhich are collections of legend entries that share common properties or characteristics.\nThe Legend properties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Position | The chart legend position can be defined asTop,Bottom,Left, orRight. When legend grouping is used the position can be eitherLeft, orRight. The legend is auto generated. If you are using wildcard, the legend uses the wildcard columns names. If you are using single y-axis value, the legend is defined as the value set inNameproperty for the layer. |\n| Use Custom Legend | When the use custom legend is enabled, the chart renders the legend using the content defined in theCustom Legendproperty instead of the default built-in legend rendering. |\n| Custom Legend | Defines a Handlebars-based template that replaces the default ChartGL legend. This allows users to fully customize the legend's appearance and behavior based on the chart's data context. |\n\n\n#### Legend Groups\n\nThese properties are used to define legend groups.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Name | Defines a name for the Legend Group. This value is added to the list displayed underLegend Groupin thegeneral layer properties. |\n| Expanded | Expands/collapses the Legend Group. |\n| Icon | Defines the icon used for the Legend Group. |\n| Regex grouping | Use this property to define a custom regular expression that dynamically groups legend items by matching patterns in their series names. This is particularly useful when visualizing large datasets with structured naming conventions, such as metrics tagged with dates, categories, or regions.By using a capturing group in the regex, for example to extract a date or category, users can simplify the legend by collapsing related metrics under a common, readable group name in the legend, improving clarity and reducing visual clutter.For example, the following regex can be used to match a string followed by a date, separated by a space such as test2025.05.29.Copy/(.+?)\\s(\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2})/The following screenshot shows a ChartGL using a regex-based legend grouping to organize series based on parts of their names.This example uses the following regex in theRegex groupingproperty.Copy/^nEngine(?<date>\\d{4}\\.\\d{2}\\.\\d{2})_(?<stat>min|max|avg)$/This regex matches strings like nEngineYYYY.MM.DD_stat, extracting date (in YYYY.MM.DD format) and stat (either min, max, or avg) as named groups.Strings starting with nEngine are considered valid matches.The series are then organized by date in the legend, and then by stat (min/max/avg).This gives users the ability to filter the data granularly as shown above. |\n\n\n### Annotations\n\nWhen enabled, Annotations allow users to define shapes or markings that provide additional information about specific data points or trends to help clarify or emphasize their significance. The annotation properties are defined in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Show Annotate Controls | Check this to display theAnnotatecontrols on the component. These controls consist of:Turn the ability tocreate annotationson/offEdit annotationsUndo annotationsRedo annotations |\n| Annotations | This field stores any changes to the default annotation type and color, and information describing the annotations. When set to aview state parameterof typestring, this information persists when saved by the user. |\n\n\n#### Annotations dialog\n\nClick Edit\nto bring up the annotations dialog.\nThe\nAnnotation Settings\nsection is where the user can view and change the default annotation type and color.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Annotation type | Sets thetype of annotation. |\n| Annotation color | Sets the color of the annotation to be created. Click on the field to bring up the color picker. TheEditsection contains a table of existing annotations each with a color button to change its color and a delete button to delete the specified annotation. The text note has an additional Edit button which brings up thetext note dialogto update the text and styling of the text note. Changes made here appear on the chart in real-time. |\n| Delete All | Deletes all annotations. |\n| OK | Commits all changes in the dialog. |\n| Cancel | Reverts all annotations to their previous state. |\n\n\n#### Annotation Types\n\nThe following table lists the different annotation types, available in the\nannotations dialog\nand how the\nAnnotate\ntoggle button appears for each type.\n\n| Annotation type | Button | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Text note |  | This is the default type. A text note is text that can be added directly to the chart. Upon creation of the text note, thetext note dialogis launched so users can edit the text and styling of the text note. To edit, double-click on the text note to bring up thetext note dialog. The text note resizes automatically based on the text and styling. The font size of the text note does not scale when the chart is zoomed in or out. To move the text note, hover over it until the mouse pointer changes to the multidirectional cursor, then click and drag it to the new position. |\n| Rectangle |  | A rectangle is a 4-sided polygon having all right angles. To move the rectangle, hover over the rectangle until the mouse pointer changes to the multidirectional cursor, then click and drag the rectangle to the new position. To resize the rectangle, hover over any endpoint until the color of the square anchor changes to redand then click and drag the endpoint to its new position. |\n| Horizontal line |  | A horizontal line is a line that extends the width of the chart. Horizontal lines can only be moved up or down. To move the horizontal line, hover over the line until the mouse pointer changes to a bidirectional cursor, then click and drag the line to its new position. |\n| Vertical line |  | A vertical line is a line extends the height of the chart. Vertical lines can only be moved left or right. To move the vertical line, hover over the line until the mouse pointer changes to a bidirectional cursor, then click and drag the line to its new position. |\n| Trend line |  | A trend line is a straight line connected by two points. To move the trend line, hover over the trend line until the mouse pointer changes to the multidirectional cursor, then click and drag the line to the new position. To resize the trend line, hover over either end of the line until the color of the square anchor changes to redand then click and drag that endpoint to its new position. |\n\n\n#### Text Note dialog\n\nWhen the\nAnnotation Type\nis set to\nText Note\nthe Text Note dialog is used to update the text and styling of the text note. Changes made to the annotation properties appears on the chart in real-time.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Text | The text to be displayed in the note. |\n| Text color | A color picker used to set the color for the text. |\n| Font size | The font size of the text. |\n| Bold | When checked, the text is bold. |\n| Text margin | Sets the space between the text note border and the text. |\n| Fill color | Sets the fill color of the text note area. Click on the field to bring up the color picker. |\n| Fill opacity | Sets the fill opacity of the text note area. Slide to the left for more transparency and to the right for more opacity. |\n| Border thickness | Sets the thickness of the text note border. |\n| Border color | Sets the border color of the text note. Click on the field to bring up the color picker. |\n| Border opacity | Sets the border opacity of the text note. Slide to the left for more transparency and to the right for more opacity. |\n| Anchor position | Sets the anchor position which identifies the corner of the text note that remains fixed on the chart. This property is particularly useful when you want the text note to always be positioned above or below an element when zooming in or out. SelectTop Leftwhen you want the text note to be precisely positioned underneath an element (for example a line, bar, or point). SelectBottom Leftwhen you want the text note to be precisely positioned above an element. |\n\n\n#### Creating annotations\n\nClicking\nAnnotate\non a chart toggles the Annotation mode. When Annotation mode is on, the\nOverlay\nand Zoom features are disabled, and an icon appears to the left of the control to indicate the current annotation type and color.\nTo create an annotation, click and hold the left mouse button on a desired area in the chart, drag the mouse to an endpoint for the annotation, and release the button. The following example shows a text note being added as an annotation.\n\n### Undo and Redo\n\nThe Undo and Redo buttons allow the user to navigate through the chronology of user actions affecting all annotations.\nClicking\nUndo\nreverses a user action affecting annotations. This includes changes made on the chart directly, or by way of the annotation dialogs. Continuing to press the Undo button reverses these user actions up to the beginning of their dashboard session.\nClicking\nRedo\nrestores annotations affected by a user clicking the Undo button. If the user performs an action affecting annotations after an Undo button press, the Redo button is disabled.\n\n### File export\n\nSee\nExport\nfor full details of common settings.\n\n### Override Rules\n\nOverride rules enable you to define custom logic that is applied consistently across all layers. By using text matching or regular expressions (regex), you can set visual styling or behaviors without needing to configure each layer individually. This makes it easy to visually distinguish layers based on names or other text.\nThere are three\nOverride Rules\n, described below. The properties displayed vary depending on the rule you select.\n- Rules are evaluated at render-time.\n- If multiple rules apply to a layer, the last one is applied.\nColumn Color\nLayer Color Palette\nAxis Formatting\nThe\nColumn Color\nrule targets a specified column, and applies a specified color to the column if the rule matches the specified text string or regex pattern. Rule properties are defined in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rule Name | Enter a name for the rule. |\n| Rule Target (Column Name) | Select the column that the rule targets, or enter a regular expression or wildcard in the data entry field, then clickAdd Custom Column.In the example above the regex/min/is used to match the stringmin. If the target column contains this string theRule Coloris applied. |\n| Use Color Palette | When unchecked, you can define use theRule Colorto define a single color for the rule.When checked, aPalette ThemeandColor Paletteselector are displayed instead of theRule Colorproperty.For any rule that appears multiple times in the chart, each instance is assigned a color from the selected palette.Palette colors are used in order of occurrence: the first match uses color 1, the second match gets color 2, and so on.If there are more occurrences than colors in the palette, the palette loops or falls back to a default strategy. |\n| Rule Color | The color to be applied to the matching column whenUse Color Paletteis unchecked. |\n\nThe\nLayer Color Palette\nrule targets a specified layer, and applies a specified color palette to the layer if the rule matches the specified text string or regex pattern. The rule properties are defined in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rule Name | Enter a name for the rule. |\n| Rule Target (Layer Name) | Select the layer that the rule targets, or enter a regular expression or wildcard in the data entry field, then clickAdd Custom Layer.In the example aboveLayer 1is selected as the layer to which the Palette Theme is applied. |\n| Palette Theme | Optionally, select the palette theme to apply to the matching layer. |\n\nThe\nAxis Formatting\nrule targets a specified axis property (prefix, suffix, or decimal places) and applies a specific string to the matching axis if the rule matches the specified text string or regex pattern. The rule properties are defined in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Rule Name | Enter a name for the rule. |\n| Rule Target (Axis) | Select the axis that the rule targets, or enter a regular expression or wildcard in the data entry field, then clickAdd Custom Axis.In the example above the axisY-Axis 1is selected, which means the rule is applied to that axis. |\n| Axis Property | The axis property that the rule targets. This can be set to:Prefix,SuffixorDecimal Places. |\n| Rule Condition | Click to specify the rule condition. Select a column or enter a regex or wildcard in the data entry field and clickAdd Custom Column.The rule is only applied to the axis if the axis is linked to a layer containing a column matching or containing this string.In the example above the regex/Eur/is specified, meaning it checks for layers that have columns containing the stringEur. |\n| Rule Action | Apply a specific string to the matching axis.In the example:In the example aboveâ¬is applied as a prefix to the axis labels when theY-Axisis linked to a layer that  has a column containing the stringEur. |\n\n\n### Style, Margins, Format\n\nSee\nStyle\nfor full details of common settings.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- Navigate Dashboards workspace\n- Configure data source connections\n- Use view states\n- Publish & Export a dashboard",

    "text": "\n# Manage Hierarchical Rules\n\nHierarchical Rules allows you to define styling and behavior rules at the dashboard level, rather than configuring them individually within each component. This makes it easier to apply consistent rules across multiple widgets, ensuring a uniform and dynamic dashboard experience.\nNote\nCurrently,\nChartGL\nis the only component that supports inheriting hierarchical rules.\nDefining these rules at the dashboard level allows you to apply them across multiple ChartGL components, eliminating the need to define them repeatedly per chart, as is the case when using the ChartGL\nOverride Rules\n.\nWith hierarchical rules, you can:\n- Apply conditional formatting across multiple components.\n- Centralize rule management to avoid duplication.\n- Create a layered rule structure where dashboard-level rules override or complement component-level rules.\n\n## Benefits\n\nUsing dashboard level hierarchical rules provides the following benefits.\n- Consistency: Ensure uniform thresholds, colors, and styles across charts, tables, and other components.\n- Efficiency: Define rules once at the dashboard level, avoiding repeated setup for each component.\n- Flexibility: Combine dashboard level rules with component level overrides for more granular control.\n\n## Configure Hierarchical Rules\n\nTo configure hierarchical rules:\n- Dashboard-level hierarchical rules are defined in  the dashboard properties. For more information, seeHierarchical Rules.\n- To use these rules in a component,  setInherit Hierarchical Rulesin the component's Basics properties. (Note: This feature is currently supported only for  ChartGL).\nWhen both local (component\nOverride Rules\n) and Hierarchical Rules are defined, local rules take precedence where applicable.\n\n## Hierarchical Rules Example\n\nThe example below demonstrates how hierarchical rules can be applied to components. It includes two ChartGL components and three hierarchical rules.\nThis example shows how to:\n- Configure hierarchical rules at the dashboard level\n- Configure the ChartGL component to use these rules\n- Override hierarchical rules\n\n### Configure Hierarchical Rules in the Dashboard\n\nThe following rules are defined and applied to both ChartGL components:\n- Column Color: A custom color is applied when the column name contains the stringWeight, changing the color to#a351a3.Rule Target=/Weight/Rule Color=#a351a3\n- Axis Formatting:  A prefix is applied the charts x-axis labels.Rule Target=/X-Axis/Axis Property=PrefixRule Condition=//Rule Action=prefix -\n- Layer Color Palette: The color palette is set to the colorblind palette for the Layer matchingLayer.Rule Name=/Layer/Palette Theme=.palette_colorblind\n\n### Configure component to use Hierarchical Rules\n\nTo ensure that both ChartGL components apply these hierarchical rules,\nInherit Hierarchical Rules\nis enabled in their\nBasics\nproperties. The screenshot below, shows this set for the top chart.\n\n### Override Hierarchical Rules\n\nIn this example, the top ChartGL component is configured to override the\nCustom Color\nhierarchical rules using the following Override Rule settings:\n- Override Rules:Custom Color\n- Rule Target (Column Name):Acceleration.\n- Rule Color:#e82560\nThis means, when the column name is\nAcceleration\n, the color is set to\n#e82560\n, overriding the color palette value for this column.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- ChartGL component",

    "text": "\n# Form Builder\n\nThis page describes how to set up and configure the Form Builder component which provides a way to create a flexible form in\nKX Dashboards\n.\nWith FormBuilder, it is easy to manage the rules governing field visibility, dropdown options, and form validation. This can be done by either:\n- Configuring the FormBuilder component properties from the front-end.\n- Adding an external kdb function from the back-end.\nIn either case, it is possible to monitor the form state and react to a user's current input, for example, by showing/hiding certain fields, changing dropdown options or updating validation rules.\nThe following shows an example of a form built with the Form Builder component.\n\n## Set Up a Form Builder\n\nTo set up a Form Builder, click-and-drag the component into the workspace and configure the following:\nBefore set-up, choose whether you want to build and manage the form using the\ncomponent properties panel\nor with an\nexternal kdb function\n.\n\n### Set Up Using the Properties Panel\n\n- Click \"+Element\" under Elements to add an element to the form schema.\n- Set its id, title, and type.\n- Add any desiredvalidators.\n- Repeat as necessary for each additional form field.\n- Create an empty dictionary view state to keep track of the form state as a user interacts with the form, and add it under either Basics > Form Values or as the output of aState Output\"Change\" action. SeeForm State Managementfor more details.\n, set Basics > Form Values to a dictionary view state.\n\t\t1. If you want an action to occur in response to changes in the form's state or when the user clicks the Submit or Cancel buttons, add an Action or a State Output action.\n, set Basics > Form Values to a dictionary view state.\n1. If you want an action to occur in response to changes in the form's state or when the user clicks the Submit or Cancel buttons, add an Action or a State Output action.\n\n### Set Up Using an External Kdb Function\n\n- Set theKdb Schemaproperty to a new empty view state parameter of type \"dictionary\". Repeat for the Form Values property (or use aState Output actioninstead).\n- Create aquery data sourcereturning a function that takes at least one argument named \"values\" and returns a dictionary with two properties, \"schema\" and \"values\", as below. More parameters may be added to this function as desired. See theForm Fieldssection below for more details on how to add more form fields.qCopy{[values]/ form field definitionsfield1:`type`title`values`default!(\"list\";\"Field 1\";(\"option1\";\"option2\");\"option1\");field2:`type`title`validators!(\"int\";\"Field 2\";enlist\"required\");/ define form schemaproperties:`field1`field2!(field1;field2);schema:`type`title`properties!(\"group\";\"A form example\";properties);/ update valueswithany missing propertiesandset them to nullvalues:@[values;(key properties)except(key values);:;`];/returndictionary defining the form`schema`values!(schema;values)}\n- In theData Dialog, set thevaluesargument to the same view state used for theForm Valuesproperty (or the same view state used in theState Outputon \"change\" action).\n- Execute the data source, to display results as shown here.\n- Click on theMappingtab in the Results table and add two rows:In the first row mapschemato theKdb Schemaview state created in step 1.The second row mapvaluesto theForm Valuesview state created in step 1.\nOnce these steps are complete, you have a data source that automatically executes in response to user input. When the user interacts with the form, the\nForm Values\nview state changes. This triggers execution of the data source. You can customize the data source to return different schema depending on the state of\nvalues\n. The result is a form that re-renders as desired in response to user input.\n\n## Form Structure\n\nForms are composed of a nested collection of form\ngroups\nand form\nfields\n. Each form field belongs to some form group containing it. Form groups may also be nested in higher-level groups to create more complex forms. A form's top-level group is called its\nschema\n.\n\n### Form Fields\n\n\n#### Form Fields Definition\n\nAll form fields have the following properties available from the property panel (if configuring from the front-end), or defined manually in an external kdb function (if configuring from the back-end). See\nexamples\nbelow for more details.\n- title(required) - The label text used in the form.\n- type(required) - Must be set to a valid kdb type. For dropdowns use \"list\". Forform sub-groups, use \"group\".\n- default(optional) - The default value of the field.\n- hidden(optional) - If true, the field is hidden on the form.\n- disabled(optional) - If true, the field is disabled.\n- ignoreOnChange(optional) - If true, the field will not trigger a \"change\"state output action.\n- classes(optional) - Adds the CSS class or classes (separated by spaces) to the field for custom styling.\n- validators(optional) - Adds form field validation.\nSome field types have extra properties. For fields of type \"symbol\":\n- password(optional) - If true, the \"password\" html input type is used, which obscures text characters with a dot (\"Â·\").\nFor dropdown fields of type \"list\", you can set the dropdown values in an external kdb function using the \"values\" property:\n- values(optional) - A kdb list corresponding to the desired dropdown values, or a kdb dictionary with \"Value\" and \"Text\" properties.\n- forceSelect(optional) - If true, force selection of the first dropdown value.\n- multiSelect(optional) - If true, allows the user to select multiple values in the dropdown.\nAlternatively, from the front-end you can create specific list items or add a data source to generate them:\n\n#### Form Fields Examples\n\n\n##### Adatefield with default value \"2020-01-31\":\n\nProperty panel example:\nKdb definition:\nCopy\n\n```\ndob:`type`title`default!(\"date\";\"Date of birth\";\"2020-01-31\");                    \n```\n\n\n##### Anintfield that is required and must be between 1 and 10 (inclusive):\n\nProperty panel example:\nKdb definition:\nCopy\n\n```\ne:\"Quantity must be an integer between 1 and 10 (inclusive)\";qv:`v1`v2!(\"required\";`type`min`max`message!(\"range\";1i;10i;e));quantity:`type`title`validators!(\"int\";\"Quantity\";qv);                    \n```\n\n\n##### A dropdownlistwith multiple value options:\n\nProperty panel example for a dropdown list with two values.\n[CDATA[        ]]\nKdb definition:\nCopy\n\n```\noptions:`type`title`values`default!(\"list\";\"Options\";(`Value`Text!(`value1`value2;`option1`option2));`option1);                    \n```\n\nAlternatively, a single list can be used to define the `values property:\nCopy\n\n```\noptions:`type`title`values`default!(\"list\";\"Options\";(`option1`option2);`option1);                    \n```\n\n\n##### Asymbolfield that checks to make sure only alphanumeric characters have been entered:\n\nProperty panel example for a symbol field with a regexp validator checking for alphanumeric characters only.\n[CDATA[       ]]\nKdb definition:\nCopy\n\n```\nuv:`type`regexp`flags`message!(\"regexp\";\"^\\\\w+$\";\"ig\";\"Invalid character\");username:`type`title`validators!(\"symbol\";\"Username\";uv);                    \n```\n\n\n### Form Groups\n\n\n#### Form Groups Definition\n\nAll form groups have the following properties available from the property panel (if configuring from the front-end), or defined manually in an external kdb function (if configuring from the back-end). See\nexamples\nbelow for more details.\n- type(required) - Must be set to \"group\".\n- title(required) - A string equal to the title of the group.\n- layout(optional) - If \"Row\" (\"Column\") is selected, then its elements are arranged in a row (column) on the form. The default is \"Column\".\nIf using kdb to define the group, then you can add elements to it using the `properties property:\n- properties- a dictionary whose keys are the ids of any form fields and sub-groups contained in the group, and whose values are those objects.\nNote\nSet top-level group to value of schema property\nThe top-level group in the form must be set to the value of the\nschema\nproperty in the kdb form definition function\nSee the\nexample above\non how to set up the form definition with an external kdb function.\nAlternatively, if defining the group from the properties panel, simply click the \"+ Element\" to add an element inside the group.\n\n#### Form Groups Examples\n\nAn example of a form group defined in kdb with the example fields defined above:\nq\nCopy\n\n```\nproperties:`dob`quantity`options`username!(dob;quantity;options;username);group1:`type`title`properties!(\"group\";\"Group1\";properties);\n```\n\nAn example of a form with two nested groups:\nq\nCopy\n\n```\nprops1:`dob`quantity!(dob;quantity);props2:`options`username!(options;username);group1:`type`title`properties!(\"group\";\"Group1\";props1);group2:`type`title`properties!(\"group\";\"Group2\";@[props2;`group1;:;group1]);\n```\n\nThis produces the following nested form when\ngroup2\nis set as the\nschema\nof the kdb form definition function:\nFrom the properties panel, the same configuration above is illustrated below:\n\n## Form State Management\n\nThere are two ways to manage the form state as the user interacts with the form.\n- Basics > Form Values: This view state property stores the current form values as a dictionary, regardless of whether the user has clicked \"Submit\" or if a particular field has theignoreOnChange propertyset to true.\n- State Output: State Output actions output the current form values as a dictionary in response to specific triggers - output on \"Change\", output on \"Submit\", output on \"Cancel\". If any field has theignoreOnChange propertyset to true, then it does not trigger the \"Change\" action if the user inputs data into that field.\nThe current form state can be used to update the form schema via an\nexternal kdb function\nor\nvirtual query\n.\n\n## Form Validation\n\nWhen the user clicks the submit button, the form checks for any input errors. If found, they are shown to the user and submission is halted. The form performs two types of validation:\n- built-in validation, depending on the kdb type of the field\n- custom validation, added to the field's properties\n\n### Built-in validation\n\nBuilt-in validation checks that the user's input matches the correct kdb type as specified in the form field's definition. For example, an form field of type\nint\nwill automatically throw an error if the user inputs a floating point number:\n\n### Custom validation\n\nThere are several types of custom validators that can be added to a form field. Multiple validators may be used together. If using kdb to define the form, validators should be defined in the form field's\nvalidators\nproperty as a dictionary, with each validator stored in the dictionary's values. See the\nform validation examples below\nfor details.\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| required | Cannot be null.Usage:\"required\" |\n| range | Must be a number in the range specified byminandmaxproperties.Usage:qCopy`type`min`max`message!(\"range\";min;max;message)wheremin,maxspecify the range andmessageis a custom error message. |\n| email | Must match a valid email format.Usage:\"email\" |\n| url | Must match a valid url.Usage: \"url\" |\n| regexp | Must match the provided regexpUsage:qCopy`type`regexp`flags`message!(\"regexp\";regexp;flags;message)whereregexpis a string regular expression,flagsis a string storing optional javascript regexp flags (such as \"i\" for case insensitive, or \"g\" for global search), andmessageis a custom error message. |\n| function | The providedconditionproperty must be false.Usage:qCopy`type`condition`message!(\"function\";condition;message)whereconditionis a boolean. If it's true, then validation fails and the custom errormessageis thrown. |\n\nValidators also have a\ndisabled\nproperty that disables the validator if set to true.\n\n#### Form Validation Examples\n\nA form field\nname2\nthat's both required and must match another field with id\nname1\ncan be defined with both the\nrequired\nand\nfunction\nvalidators as below:\nq\nCopy\n\n```\nname1:`type`title!(\"symbol\";\"Name1\");validators:`v1`v2!(\"required\";`type`condition`message!(\"function\";values[`name1]<>values[`name2];\"Must match name1\"));name2:`type`title`validators!(\"symbol\";\"Name2\";validators);\n```\n\nIn this case the\nrequired\nvalidator is checked first, and if that passes, then the\nmatch\nvalidator is checked. In the example below, it fails:\n\n## Form Builder properties\n\nThe following sections provides details on how to configure the properties of the Form Builder component.\n\n### Basics\n\nOpen the Basics properties on the right and configure the properties described in the following table.\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Name | Enter a name for the component provided. |\n| Kdb Schema | An empty type dictionaryview state parameter.

The benefit of using this Map component over the standard\nMap (External API)\ncomponent is that you do not need to have external access to the internet or external APIs.\nThere is a wide range of customizations available for the Map including adjusting styles, colors, fonts, adding custom icons and interactive layers (including Points, Circles, Lines, Animated Points, Heatmaps, and customizable Layers).\nNote\nTwo Map components\nKX Dashboards\nincludes two Map components, both displaying geographical data but used for different purposes. To use the\nMap (External API)component\n, you need a stable internet connection and access to external APIs. If you need to use maps offline, the\nMap\ncomponent described on this page allows you to visualize geographical data without the need of an internet connection or access to external APIs. The properties you can set for the two maps are different so it's recommended you choose which component to use based on your needs.\nThe following screenshot illustrates a sample Map with defined circles.\nThe Map has features that enable you to:\n- Visualize and animate geographic data\n- Visualize streaming and moving data geographically\n- Display and interact with large quantities of data on a map\n- Query and filter map features\n- Dynamically display and style custom client-side data on a map\n- Programmatically add points, circles, lines, and popups to maps\n- Annotate polygons and lines on geographic data and store annotated points in view states for use in other components\n- Overlay multiple layers of data on top of each other\nNote\nThe Map component is built using the MapLibre libraries.\nThe following sections describe how to configure the properties of the Map component.\n\n## Set up an offline Map\n\nTo set up an offline Map component, click-and-drag the component into the workspace and configure the following:\nRefer to Offline Map properties described in the next section for details on additional properties.\n\n## Offline Map properties\n\nThe following sections provides details on how to configure the properties of the Offline Map component.\n\n### Basics\n\nOpen the Basics properties on the right and configure the properties described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Name | Enter a name for the component. |\n| Track Load Time | When this is checked, the time it takes to load the Map is tracked in theLoad Time (ms)field below.

An example of a text file converted to GeoJSON is shown below.\nConfigure the Simple Layer properties described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Type | Determine the layer type, which can be either GeoJSON or vector. |\n| Name |  |\n| Data | The data used by the layer (specified in either JSON or GeoJSON format)Example:{ \"type\":\"FeatureCollection\", \"features\": [{ \"type\":\"Feature\", \"properties\": { \"scalerank\":3,\"area_sqkm\":1002.565, \"featureclass\":\"Urban area\" }, \"geometry\": { \"type\":\"Polygon\", \"coordinates\":[[[-121.37881303595779,38.39168793390614],[-121.37881303595779,38.39168793390614],[-121.37881303595779,38.39168793390614],[-121.42144609259859,38.3858743352733],[-121.48040890184362,38.39168793390614],[-121.51616899298959,38.444811306302185],[-121.58203060594559,38.4678848333205],[-121.5930118478076,38.626428127591964],[-121.46772233771595,38.671102403308296],[-121.39491024461671,38.75068410903778],[-121.31532853888723,38.82349620213702],[-121.23913163947286,38.82349620213702],[-121.19226111538413,38.73701569269657],[-121.13750993537089,38.65836416274834],[-121.19386308478518,38.61312144627681],[-121.26453060594432,38.58219310155013],[-121.32057369676485,38.53666616470099],[-121.37881303595779,38.4933096380081],[-121.37062232143953,38.43667226821621],[-121.37881303595779,38.39168793390614]]] } } }] } |\n| Properties | The style properties used by the layer.Example:{ \"id\": \"urban-areas-fill\", \"type\": \"fill\", \"source\": \"urban-areas\", \"layout\": {}, \"paint\": { \"fill-color\": \"#f08\", \"fill-opacity\": 0.4 } } |\n| Tooltip |  |\n| Show Tooltip |  |\n\nNote\nAsset storage\nTo avoid having to use any external APIs we store all our assets including glyphs, images, and tiles in the \"css\\assets\\\" folder inside the component code.\n\n#### Raster Layers\n\nRaster layers represent data as a grid of pixels, where each pixel holds a value corresponding to information such as temperature, elevation, satellite imagery, or precipitation.\nThe Raster Layer properties allow you to add custom map layers from external sources, such as WMS (Web Map Service) or WMTS (Web Map Tile Service) endpoints, to enrich spatial analysis. This gives you flexibility to overlay aviation, maritime, elevation, or other geospatial datasets on top of the map component.\nThis example shows a Raster Layer using WMS:\nThis example shows a Raster Layer using WMST:\nConfigure the Raster Layer properties described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Name | A descriptive label for the raster layer. This is used to identify the layer in the dashboard (for example.,Weather Radar. |\n| Tile URL | The URL template for requesting tiles from your WMS or WMTS service.This must include the necessary parameters (for example,bbox,srs/epsg,width,height,format).A viewstate can be used to set the URL. |\n| Tile Size | Defines the pixel dimensions of each map tile (typically 256 or 512). This must match the service configuration to ensure tiles display correctly. |\n\n\n### Margins\n\nRefer to\nMargins\nfor details.\n\n### Format\n\nRefer to\nFormat\nfor details.\n\n## Drawing a line\n\nThis section describes how to draw a line on a map to calculate the distance between 2 or more spots. Once the line is drawn, the distance (in kilometers) is shown in a popup. An example of this is illustrated in the following screenshot.\nTo draw a line annotation on an Map:\n- In the annotation control, on the right-hand side of the map, click on the line icon.\n- Select the starting point on the map by using a left or right mouse click.\n- You can click at any other point on the map to connect this line.\n- The line is displayed as a yellow dashed line while editing.\n- Once you are finished editing you can click on the line. This sets the line to blue.\nTo delete a line from an Map:\n- Select the line and click on the trash icon in the annotations properties, on the left-hand side of the map.\n\n## Drawing a polygon\n\nThis section describes how to draw a polygon on an Map by selecting a set of points/circles. This is illustrated in the following screenshot.\nTo draw a polygon on an Map:\n- In Preview mode, click on the polygon icon in the annotation controls, on the right-hand side of the map.\n- Click on the map where you want to start the polygon and then click on multiple sections of the map to connect the polygon points.\n- The polygon is displayed as a yellow dashed line while editing.\n- Once you are finished editing, you can click on the line. This sets the polygon to blue.\nNote\nIf\nZoom on Draw\nis checked then the map zooms in on the polygon after the polygon is applied. If\nFilter on Draw\nis checked then the map only displays the points/circles inside the polygon shape after the polygon is applied.\nTo delete a polygon:\n- Select the polygon and click on the trash icon in the annotations menu.\n\n## Tile Server Installation\n\nKX Dashboards\nuses\ntileserver-GL\n, a self-hosted map tile serv er for use whe n leveraging web-based maps and online map tilers are unavailable to be used in offline use cases and air gapped environments.\nNote\nTile Server Documentation\nTile Server Github guide can be found here\nhttps://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl\nFull documentation can be found here\nhttps://tileserver.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n- Latest Version of KX Dashboards 2.2.5 or greater or KX platform build 4.9.2 or greater\n- Node JS 18.17.0 or greater\n- https://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl\n\n### Operating systems\n\n- Windows (x64) or greater\n- Ubuntu 22.04 or greater\n- macOS 14 (x64/arm64) or greater\n\n### Getting Started\n\nInstall from npm, to the directory which you wish to install to.\nChoose from one of the following options:\nOption 1\n: Install globally from npmjs\nBASH\nCopy\n\n```\nnpm install -g tileserver-gl\n```\n\nOption 2\n: Install locally from source\nBASH\nCopy\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl.git    cd tileserver-gl    npm install\n```\n\nNote\nUsing tileserver-gl-light\ntileserver-gl-light can be used but is unable to handle any raster functions, if this is required for future use, please install the full version\n\n#### Map Data\n\nTo render data offline, an mbtiles file is required for the area of interest. While there are many ways to acquire and create mbtiles files, it is recommended that you use the mbtiles files here:\nhttps://osm.dbtc.link/mbtiles/\nNote\nmbtiles Recommendation\n- Recommended mbtiles file download - 2024-06-25-planet.mbtiles\n- This mbtiles file is for OpenStreetMap Data that was last updated in June 2024.As this is a static file, map updates must be obtained by the user.\n- KX is not responsible for providing map updates.\n\n#### Adding Map Data and Styles\n\nOnce the OpenStreetMap (OSM) data is downloaded, this needs to be copied to the same directory as the tileserver-gl install (along with the accompanying config.json file, if present).\nThe following URL can be used to obtain a set of sample fonts and files for the tile server:\nhttps://github.com/maptiler/tileserver-gl/releases/download/v1.3.0/test_data.zip\nFrom the test_data.zip file, the styles and fonts directories should be copied to the tileserver-gl installation folder.\nNote\nTile Server Configuration File\nThe config.json file in Tile Server GL configures map styles, fonts, and data sources for the server. It helps define how map data is rendered, including the structure of the directories containing styles and fonts. If no config.json is defined for Tile Server GL, the server will use its default settings for rendering map tiles.\nThe config.json file in Tile Server GL configures map styles, fonts, and data sources for the server. It helps define how map data is rendered, including the structure of the directories containing styles and fonts. If no config.json is defined for Tile Server GL, the server will use its default settings for rendering map tiles.\nThe tileserver-gl directory structure should therefore look similar to this:\nInside the styles folder, the following styles are provided: osm-bright and klokantech-basic.\nNote\nAdditional styles\nAdditional styles can be added by following the user guide in the tileserver-gl documentation.\n\n#### Before you start the tile server\n\nTileserver-gl defaults to port 8080, therefore it is important to assign a new port config when starting the tileserver-gl, to target a different port as your KX Install will likely conflict with this port assignment.\nIt is recommended to use port 8082, which was tested abd working.\nFor longer term use, it is recommended that the user write a startup script for ease of deployment, KX is not responsible for providing this.\nStart up code below:\nBASH\nCopy\n\n```\ntileserver-gl 2024-06-25-planet.mbtiles -p 8082\n```\n\n\n### KX DashboardsTile server Integration\n\n- Drag the Map component onto the canvas.\n- In the Tile Server property section, checkEnable.\n- The Style can be specified in one of two ways:Using a URLUsing the Editor\n\n#### Set the style using URL\n\n- CheckSet Style using a URL.\n- Using a browser, navigate to the host and port for the Tile Server. Right click the link for the chosen Style and copy the link to the clipboard.\n- Paste the URL into theStyle URLproperty inKX Dashboards\n- Save and r eload/ refresh the page.\n\n#### Set the style using Editor\n\n- UncheckSet Style using a URL.\n- Using a browser, navigate to the host and port for the Tile Server.

    "text": "\n# Dashboard Performance Monitoring\n\nThis page provides insight into the runtime performance of dashboard queries. It shows how queries behave while dashboards are actively in use, helping teams identify slow, failing, or timed-out queries before they impact end users.\nDashboard Performance Monitoring captures query execution metrics based on real user activity, enabling teams to diagnose issues quickly and track performance trends over time.\nThis information helps teams understand how individual queries contribute to overall dashboard performance.\n\n## Why this is useful\n\nDashboards often depend on multiple queries and data sources. If one query performs poorly, it can slow down or break the entire dashboard. Without performance monitoring, these issues are typically discovered only after users report problems.\n\n### Query performance monitoring\n\nQuery performance monitoring is useful because it:\n- Measures execution time for each dashboard query\n- Identifies slow-running queries\n- Surfaces failed or timed-out queries\n- Helps pinpoint queries that require optimization\nBy providing visibility into query behavior at runtime, it allows you to address performance issues proactively instead of reactively.\n\n## Key benefits\n\nUsing Dashboard Performance Monitoring, you can:\n- Quickly identify which queries are impacting overall dashboard performance\n- Investigate issues as they occur, rather than relying on user reports\n- Capture performance data while dashboards are actively in use\n- Reflects real-world usage rather than test or synthetic runs\n- Perform live diagnostics when dashboards become slow or unresponsive\n\n## How to access Dashboard Performance Monitoring\n\n- Open the menu icon in the top-left corner of the dashboard\n- Navigate toQueries\n- SelectTesting Page\nThe\nTesting Page\ndisplays performance information for dashboard queries, allowing you to monitor execution behavior while dashboards are in use.\n\n## Next steps\n\n- Learn how toadd Google Analytics to Dashboards.",

    "text": "\n# Drop Down List\n\nThis page describes how to set up and configure the Drop Down List component to your dashboard.\nThe following example shows a Bubble Chart with a drop down list.\n\n## Set up a Drop Down List\n\nTo set up a Drop Down List component, click-and-drag the component into the workspace and configure the following:\n- Define theview state parameterto map to the dropdown.\n- Use either adata sourceoritemlist to populate your dropdown.\n- Give your dropdown alabel, checkMulti-selectif required\nRefer to Drop Down List properties described in the next section for details on additional properties.\n\n## Drop Down List properties\n\nThe following sections provides details on how to configure the properties of the Drop Down List component.\n\n### Basics\n\nOpen the Basics properties on the right and configure the properties described in the following table.\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Name | Enter a name for the component. |\n| Data Source | Create adata sourcewith the content of the dropdown menu. Using a data source automatically populates the dropdown, just ensure the data source has values in the correct format and type to pass into the linkedSelected ValueView State Parameter. An optional text column can be included for value display names. The following screenshot shows a query for a drop down List data source.The following sample query can be used if connecting to the sample data connection sourcehtmlevalcongroupavailable in the sample demo dashboard set:qCopyselect distinct srcfromdfxQuote |\n| Selected Value | The view state parameter populated by the dropdown selection.Selected values |\n| Label | The label next to the dropdown. |\n| Accept Empty Values | When checked, an available null value is added to the selectionA dropdown with an empty-value optionNoteNull value must be part of available dataWhen  enabled, ensure the data column supplying the dropdown menu contains a null value.  This will not add a null value if not already available. |\n| Force Selected Value | When checked, the dropdown populates aSelected ValueView State Parameterwith either the defined default or selected value. This ensures any associated queries dependent on the dropdown input will have a value assigned to theView State Parameter.NoteLimited by available selection in dropdownIf the dropdownView State Parameteris used by another user input, such asText Input,, theView State Parameteruses the most recent, viable value. If an outside range value is set in aText Input, the dropdownView State Parametershows the last selected value BUT theView State Parameterupdates to the (now) outside range value, which may break any query using the associatedView State Parameter |\n| Multi-select | When checked, multiple selections can be made from the dropdown list and the selected items passed to the Selected Value View State Parameter.This controls the display of theSelect All by Defaultproperty. |\n| Select All by Default | This property is displayed whenMulti-selectis checked.When checked, all items in the dropdown are automatically selected. This ensures the dropdown is fully populated and the associated view state is updated immediately, without requiring manual user selection.For example, the following dropdown has bothMulti-selectandSelect All by Defaultenabled. When the user opens the dropdown, all items are selected. |\n| Show Search | When checked, includes a search box for filtering results |\n| Advanced Search | Supports wildcard searches, along withAND,ORand for excluding items from search using-. For example,EUR and GBP,EUR or GBP,EUR -*GBP |\n| Horizontal | Set the horizontal alignment of items within the list. |\n| Vertical | Set the vertical alignment of items within the list. |\n| Tooltip | Enter a text description to appear when user mouses over the dropdown. |\n| Width | Set the pixel width of menu and dropdownLabel. If theLabelis wider thanLabel Width, it wraps. |\n| Label Width |\n| Field Summary Threshold | How many items are shown in the input field before changing to summary. For example, 3 of 20 when value of3is set. |\n| Tooltip Summary Threshold | How many items are shown in the tooltip before changing to summary. For example, 10 of 20 when value of10is set. |\n| 'Select All' Value | This is the value assigned to theSelected Valueviewstate when all items are selected in the dropdown. In the absence of an all-select, each individual selected item is listed in theSelected Valueviewstate. The default value isall.TipConfigurationThe defined value is used instead of the full list when all items are selected. That is,  your backend must expectallrather than the full list. This value can also be set as the default value if using a view state to ensure all items are selected on load. |\n| Sort List by Selected | When checked and the dropdown is expanded to show the items available for selection, the selected values are displayed at the top of the list. |\n\n\n### Data Source Mapping\n\nConfigure the properties, described in the following table.\nWhen a\nData Source\nis used to populate the Drop Down List, the items of the\nData Source\nare automatically assigned.

    "text": "\n# Tree Map\n\nThis page describes how to set up and configure the Treemap component.\nTreemaps are particularly useful for visualizing large amounts of data in a compact space. For example, they can be used to visualize financial data, such as the market share of different companies within an industry.\nTree Maps\nare best used in conjunction with\nPivot Queries\n. The screenshot below is an example of a treemap.\nThis section provides information on the following:\n- How to set up a treemap\n- Basic properties\n- Column data\n- Color palette\n- Node properties\n- Tooltip\n- Group by option\n- Animation\n- File export\n- Style\n- Format\n- Margins\n\n## Set up a Tree Map\n\nTo set up a Treemap component, click and drag the component into the workspace and configure the following:\n- Click to populate Data Sourceor define aData Sourcefrom theBasics properties. Click New and proceed with configuring theData Source.\n- AssignCategoryandbox sizefrom the data source withColumnandSize.\n- From theColor Palette, choose a color format. Options go from single color, color gradient to iterative.NoteIn a treemap, data is grouped in nodes/boxes, and each node/box represents a part of the dataset.\nRefer to Treemap properties described in the next section for details on additional properties.\n\n## Treemap properties\n\nThe following sections provides details on how to configure the properties of the Treemap component.\n\n### Basics\n\nOpen the Basics properties on the right and configure the properties described in the following table.\n\n| property | description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Name | Enter a name for the component. |\n| Data Source | Set up adata source. |\n| Focus | Select aView State Parameterforlinking components. |\n| Selected Value | Set aView State Parameterto store the last (most recent) selected interaction. |\n\n\n#### Action\n\nActions are a common property set used to configure a\nview state\n, run a query, or open an URL. For more information on how to configure these, see\nActions\n.\n\n### Data\n\nOpen the Data properties to configure your columns by setting the properties described in the table below.\nNote\nAdding more than one data series\nThe treemap display nested rectangles, where each level of the hierarchy is represented by a larger rectangle containing smaller rectangles. This helps in visualizing the relationship between different data series.\n\n| property | description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Column | Sets theData sourcevariable for node labels. This defines how node are categorized into groups. Set to{breakdownId}for Pivot queries. |\n| Name | The title name forColumn. Set this to{breakdownId}for Pivot queries. |\n| Size | TheData sourcevariable used for scaling the node size. This represents the numeric values that determine the size of each node in the treemap. The size of each node is proportional to its value. |\n| Color | TheData sourcevariable used to define color shading. This represents the numeric values that can determine the color of each node in the treemap. |\n\n\n### Highlight rules\n\nExpand the Highlight Rules property, add a rule and expand it to set the following properties.\n\n| property | description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Opacity | Strength of highlight rule color, where 0 is transparent (retaining underlying treemap color palette), 100 is opaque, and 50 offers a hybrid shading of halfBackground Colorand half of the base treemap color palette. |\n| Inverse | Inverse application of color palette and highlight color. |\n\nFor more information and the description of the remaining properties in this section, see\nHighlight Rules\n.\n\n### Color palette\n\nFrom the\nColor Palette\nproperty, select the color options for your treemap. Define the properties as described in the table below.\nNested Table Example\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Coloring | Select from:Fixed: This option uses a single, static color for all elements. Itâs useful when you want a uniform look without any variation.Iterative: This assigns different colors to each element in a sequence. For example, if you have multiple categories, each one gets a distinct color from a predefined palette.Iterative Children: Similar to iterative, but it applies the colors to child elements within a parent category. This is helpful for visualizing hierarchical data where you want to distinguish subcategories.Scaled: This option uses a range of colors based on the values of the data. Higher values might be one color and lower values another, with a gradient in between. For example, you can use it for showing intensity or magnitude.Gradient: This applies a smooth transition between two or more colors across the data range. Itâs useful for showing gradual changes in data values.Gradient Percentage: This is a specific type of gradient that maps colors to percentage values, typically between 0 and 100%. Itâs often used for progress indicators or performance metrics.NoteGradient Percentage requires a Size range of between 0 and 1. |\n| Fixed Color | This is used whenColoringis set toFixed. |\n| Selected Color | The color of the Treemap area on click-selection. |\n| Hover Color | The color of the Treemap area on mouse hover. |\n| Palette Theme | SeePalette Themefor more information. |\n\n\n### Color Scheme\n\nFor more information on the Color Scheme, see\nPalettes\n.\n\n### Node\n\nIn a treemap, a node represents a rectangle that visualizes a specific category or subcategory within the hierarchical structure of the data. The table below describes the properties you can set for a node.\nNested Table Example\n\n| property | description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Show Label | When checked, it displays the Treemap data labels. |\n| Format | General: Displays the data as it is; no specific formatting.Number: Used for numerical data.Smart Number: Automatically adjusts the display of numbers based on their size.Formatted Number: Advanced formatting for numbers, like adding prefixes or suffixes (currency, symbols), controlling decimal places, and applying custom number formats.Datetime: Used for date and time data. | General: Displays the data as it is; no specific formatting. | Number: Used for numerical data. | Smart Number: Automatically adjusts the display of numbers based on their size. | Formatted Number: Advanced formatting for numbers, like adding prefixes or suffixes (currency, symbols), controlling decimal places, and applying custom number formats. | Datetime: Used for date and time data. |\n| General: Displays the data as it is; no specific formatting. |\n| Number: Used for numerical data. |\n| Smart Number: Automatically adjusts the display of numbers based on their size. |\n| Formatted Number: Advanced formatting for numbers, like adding prefixes or suffixes (currency, symbols), controlling decimal places, and applying custom number formats. |\n| Datetime: Used for date and time data. |\n| Label Color | Set the font color for the label. |\n| Date/Time Format | Use when Datetime is selected forFormat. |\n| Hide Trailing Zeros | Remove extra zeros at the end of a digit. |\n| Precision | The number of decimal places used whenFormatis set to:Number,Smart NumberorFormatted Number. |\n| Suffix / Prefix | Add a symbol before or after Node label. |\n| Custom Label | Add a custom label for additional information displayed on Treemap.For example:Sample configuration: |\n| Min Value / Max Value | Defined from Size value range. |\n| Show Legend | This is a toggle display of gradient or Name legend. |\n| Border Color / Border Width / Gap Width | Set pixel width and color of border. |\n| Show Node Header / Header Font Color / Header Height / Header Font Size | Display Name as header and define Header style. |\n| Show Color Scale Index | Display the color scale index text. |\n| Scale Node Size | When enabled, nodes are scaled by Size variable. |\n\n\n### Tooltip\n\nTooltips show data values associated with the cursor position.

    "text": "\n# Navigation Menu\n\nThis page explains how to set up the Navigation Menu component, enabling you to incorporate drop-down menus to your\nKX Dashboards\n.\nA navigation menu can connect users to a variety of resources, including other\nKX Dashboards\n, external websites, support pages, help resources, user guides, and more.\nThe following screenshot shows an example menu with links to other\nKX Dashboards\n. Configuration of this example is described in the sections below.\nTip\nTwo levels of menu are supported.\n\n## Set up a Navigation Menu\n\nThis section outlines the configuration steps. A\ndetailed example\nis provided in the next section.\n- Click and drag the component into the workspace.\n- Define the following properties:PropertyDescriptionNameEnter a name for the component.Data SourceConfigure thedata source, which defines the menu structure.Font SizeSelect a font size for the menu items.NodeConfigure theNodesto map each of the menu elements to the columns in your data source. This is only required if your column names differ from the default columns; Node, Parent, URL, and ID.ActionsYou can configureActions, a common property set, to manage view states, run queries, or open URLs here.Style/Format/MarginsConfigure theStyle, Margins and Formatfor the menu.\n\n### Data source\n\nThe\nData Source\ndefines the menu structure for the component. For static data, such as navigation menu generation, we recommend using JavaScript in the Virtual tab. This approach is faster and operates independently of the backend process.\n- In the component,Click to populate Data Sourceor clickData Sourcein the Basics properties to open the Data dialog. ClickNewto proceed.The data source, for the Navigation Menu, requires 4 columns which are described in the following table.Column NameDescriptionNodeThis is the name of an individual menu item. It can be a top level or drop-down menu item. Each node can be associated with a URL. Each node has a parent (node) defined. If the node is a top-level item in the menu, enter a blank value as its parent. See theexamplebelow.ParentA parent is a node that has one or more child nodes. In a hierarchical navigation menu, a parent node can be expanded to reveal its child nodes. For instance, theProduct Demosparent node, in the example at the top of this page, has the child nodes Demo Health and Demo Sensors.URLThis is theURLorUUIDslinked to each node/menu option. The UUID of a Dashboard is the part afteredit/in the Dashboard URL. For example, in the URLhttps://ui-dash.kx.com/dash-main/edit/#f856763f-d4c6-8c6d-6c62-991b299a1a16, the UUID is #f856763f-d4c6-8c6d-6c62-991b299a1a16.When using this component in kdb Insights Enterprise Views, prependviewto the UUID. For example,view#53c5e521-2d14-4d6d-fe61-16ca42cea162. This is not required if you are using absolute URLs such as https://code.kx.com.If you want to add a link to the shared view of the View, prependview/shareto the UUID. For example,view/share#53c5e521-2d14-4d6d-fe61-16ca42cea162.This is not required if you are using absolute URLs such as https://code.kx.com. You can avoid manually addingviewandview/shareby using the following code before thecallbackfunction in the JavaScript used to create your menu in the Virtual tab.JavaScriptCopy_.each(results.rows, r => {if(r.url.indexOf(\"#\") ===0) {r.url = ($(\"kx-report-editor\").length ?\"view\": $(\"kx-report-viewer\").length ?\"view/share\":\"\") + r.url;}});This is shown in theviews examplebelow.IDThe ID is a unique identifier assigned to each node/menu item. It helps in distinguishing between different nodes, especially when manipulating the menu programmatically.You can use different column names in the data source definition, but you must map them to the correct elements using theNodeproperties.\n- Once you have configured the data source, clickApplyandSelect Item.\n- Next, you need to map the columns defined in your data source to theNodes.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following sections provides examples of setting up the Navigation Menu in:\n- KX Dashboards\n- kdb Insights Enterprise Views.\n\n### KX Dashboardsexample\n\nThe following Javascript code creates the example shown in the\nKX Dashboards\nscreenshot at the top of this page.\nJavaScript\nCopy\n\n```\nfunction (source, callback) {    const results = {};    // source is an object representing a data source, with the following properties:    // columns: an array of column names, for example,    results.columns = [      \"node\",      \"parent\",      \"url\",      \"id\"    ];    // meta: an object mapping column names to their kdb types    results.meta = {      \"node\": 0,      \"parent\": 0,      \"url\": 0,      \"id\": 7    };    // rows: an array of row objects, each one maps columns to values    results.rows = [      {\"node\":\"Visualizations Demos\",\"parent\":\"\",\"url\":\"#53c5e521-2d14-4d6d-fe61-16ca42cea162\",\"id\":1001},      {\"node\":\"Products Demos\",\"parent\":\"\",\"url\":\"#b206840b-2e64-4209-bacd-166c883928f\",\"id\":1002},      {\"node\":\"Component Demos\",\"parent\":\"\",\"url\":\"#80c52499-cd0a-a1ca-46bb-178be3aaeed\",\"id\":1003},      {\"node\":\"Demo Visualize\",\"parent\":\"Visualizations Demos\",\"url\":\"#53c5e521-2d14-4d6d-fe61-16ca42cea162\",\"id\":1004},      {\"node\":\"Demo Health\",\"parent\":\"Products Demos\",\"url\":\"#b206840b-2e64-4209-bacd-166c883928f\",\"id\":1005},      {\"node\":\"Demo Sensors\",\"parent\":\"Products Demos\",\"url\":\"#c02f1251-9300-2c35-9efe-85a0b87665f4\",\"id\":1006},      {\"node\":\"Data\",\"parent\":\"Component Demos\",\"url\":\"#80c52499-cd0a-a1ca-46bb-178be3aaeed\",\"id\":1007},      {\"node\":\"Graph\",\"parent\":\"Component Demos\",\"url\":\"#b58fe5e3-d02f-3130-2e53-5bddc0bbac3d\",\"id\":1008}    ];    // you can perform operations on the source, generate values or fetch remote data using javascript    // when you are done pass an object in the same format as source to the callback function to return your data    callback(results);    }\n```\n\nThis example contains the following elements:\n\n| Element | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| function (source, callback) | Defines an anonymous function that takes two parameters: source and callback. |\n| const results = {} | An empty object, called results, is created to store the processed data. |\n| results.columns | Defines the required columns; that is node, parent, url, and id. |\n| results.meta | Maps the columns to their types. |\n| results.rows | Set to an array of objects, each representing a row of data with values for the columns defined earlier. |\n| callback(results) | The callback function is called with the results object as its argument, passing the processed data back to the function that called this one. |\n\nThe following screenshot illustrates this data source configuration in the\nVirtual\ntab.\nThis creates the menu structure as per the following table:\n\n| Node | Parent | URL | ID |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Visualizations Demos |  | #53c5e521-2d14-4d6d-fe61-16ca42cea162 | 1001 |\n| Products Demos |  | #b206840b-2e64-4209-bacd-166c883928f | 1002 |\n| Component Demos |  | #80c52499-cd0a-a1ca-46bb-178be3aaeed | 1003 |\n| Demo Visualize | Visualizations Demos | #53c5e521-2d14-4d6d-fe61-16ca42cea162 | 1004 |\n| Demo Health | Products Demos | #b206840b-2e64-4209-bacd-166c883928f | 1005 |\n| Demo Sensors | Products Demos | #c02f1251-9300-2c35-9efe-85a0b87665f4 | 1006 |\n| Data | Component Demos | #80c52499-cd0a-a1ca-46bb-178be3aaeed | 1007 |\n| Graph | Component Demos | #b58fe5e3-d02f-3130-2e53-5bddc0bbac3d | 1008 |\n\nThe first three values in the Node column are Visualizations Demos, Products Demos, and Component Demos. These are main menu items because their corresponding Parent column is empty.\nThe drop-down menu for any main menu item has that main menu as their parent. For example, Component Demos has two items in its drop-down menu; Data and Graph.\n\n### Views example\n\nThe example below shows a navigation menu in kdb Insights Enterprise Views.\nThe following code created this navigation menu.\nJavaScript\nCopy\n\n```\nfunction (source, callback) {    const results = {};    // source is an object representing a data source, with the following properties:    // columns: an array of column names, for example,    results.columns = [        \"node\",        \"parent\",        \"url\",        \"id\"    ];    // meta: an object mapping column names to their kdb types    results.meta = {        \"node\": 0,        \"parent\": 0,        \"url\": 0,        \"id\": 7    };    // rows: an array of row objects, each one maps columns to values    results.rows = [        {\"node\":\"Menu1\",\"parent\":\"\", \"url\":\"#4991a5d8-2b08-4247-a56c-d04e3a12c542\",\"id\":1001},        {\"node\":\"Menu2\",\"parent\":\"\",\"url\":\"#4991a5d8-2b08-4247-a56c-d04e3a12c542\",\"id\":1002},        {\"node\":\"Menu3\",\"parent\":\"\",\"url\":\"#7d9afdf7-6915-45c6-9648-5f9c78e30827\",\"id\":1003},        {\"node\":\"View1\",\"parent\":\"Menu1\",\"url\":\"#4991a5d8-2b08-4247-a56c-d04e3a12c542\",\"id\":1004},        {\"node\":\"View2\",\"parent\":\"Menu2\",\"url\":\"#5a5b2cfd-6a7f-4815-9c00-eb97f8ff00ed\",\"id\":1005},        {\"node\":\"View3\",\"parent\":\"Menu2\",\"url\":\"#7d9afdf7-6915-45c6-9648-5f9c78e30827\",\"id\":1006},        {\"node\":\"View4\",\"parent\":\"Menu3\",\"url\":\"#7901772c-5cbf-404e-9fe9-672238e55a0d\",\"id\":1007},        {\"node\":\"View5\",\"parent\":\"Menu3\",\"url\":\"#b846675c-3df7-42b3-b248-8fe3e073a616\",\"id\":1008},        {\"node\":\"View5\",\"parent\":\"Menu3\",\"url\":\"#8928ff46-e47d-496d-8d07-129540e2c1da\",\"id\":1008}    ];    // you can perform operations on the source, generate values or fetch remote data using javascript    // when you are done pass an object in the same format as source to the callback function to return your data    _.each(results.rows, r => {        if (r.url.indexOf(\"#\") === 0) {            r.url = ($(\"kx-report-editor\").length ? \"view\" : $(\"kx-report-viewer\").length ? \"view/share\" : \"\") + r.url;        }    });    callback(results);    }\n```\n\nThis JavaScript example contains the following elements:\n\n| Element | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| function (source, callback) | Defines an anonymous function that takes two parameters: source and callback. |\n| const results = {} | An empty object, called results, is created to store the processed data. |\n| results.columns | Defines the required columns; that is node, parent, url, and id. |\n| results.meta | Maps the columns to their types. |\n| results.rows | Set to an array of objects, each representing a row of data with values for the columns defined earlier. |\n| callback(results) | The callback function is called with the results object as its argument, passing the processed data back to the function that called this one. |\n| _.each(results.rows ... | This section checks each row, and if the URL starts with \"#\", it adds \"view\" or \"view/share\" to the beginning of the URL based on whether certain elements are present in the page. |\n\nThe following screenshot illustrates this data source configuration in the\nVirtual\ntab.\nThis creates the menu structure as per the following table:\n\n| Node | Parent | URL | ID |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Menu1 |  | view#4991a5d8-2b08-4247-a56c-d04e3a12c542 | 1001 |\n| Menu2 |  | view#4991a5d8-2b08-4247-a56c-d04e3a12c542 | 1002 |\n| Menu3 |  | view#7d9afdf7-6915-45c6-9648-5f9c78e30827 | 1003 |\n| View1 | Menu1 | view#4991a5d8-2b08-4247-a56c-d04e3a12c542 | 1004 |\n| View2 | Menu2 | view#5a5b2cfd-6a7f-4815-9c00-eb97f8ff00ed | 1005 |\n| View3 | Menu2 | view#7d9afdf7-6915-45c6-9648-5f9c78e30827 | 1006 |\n| View4 | Menu3 | view#7901772c-5cbf-404e-9fe9-672238e55a0d | 1007 |\n| View5 | Menu3 | view#b846675c-3df7-42b3-b248-8fe3e073a616 | 1008 |\n| View5 | Menu3 | view#8928ff46-e47d-496d-8d07-129540e2c1da | 1008 |\n\nThe first three values in the Node column are Menu1, Menu2, Menu3.

This is a required column.For example,Parent Nodesdefined byparentId(null values are underlined, with an alternative date type hierarchy given inparentId2) in the following query:qCopy([]id:(1;2;3;4;5;6;7;8;9;10;11;12;13;14;15;16;17;18;19;20;21;22;23;24;25;26;27;28;29;30;31;32;33;34;35;36;37;38;39;40;41;42;43;44;45;46;47;48;49;50;51;52;53;54;55;56;57;58;59;60;62);parent:(0n;1;1;1;1;2;2;6;6;7;8;8;9;9;10;10;3;3;3;3;17;17;4;4;23;23;23;24;24;28;28;29;29;5;5;5;0n;37;37;37;37;37;37;37;37;37;37;0n;48;49;49;49;49;49;48;55;48;57;10;37;37);level:(1222233444555555333345334444455553331222222222212333332323522);name:(\"What would you like to show?\";\"Comparison\";\"Distribution\";\"Composition\";\"Relationship\";\"Over Time\";\"Among Items\";\"Many Periods\";\"Few Periods\";\"Few Categories\";\"Linear Data\";\"Cyclical Data\";\"Single or Few Category\";\"Multi Category\";\"Many Items\";\"Few Items\";\"Single Variable\";\"Two Variables\";\"Three Variables\";\"Four Variables\";\"Few Data Points\";\"Many Data Points\";\"Static\";\"Changing over Time\";\"Simple Share of Total\";\"Simple Share Grouped\";\"Accumulation or substraction to total\";\"Few Periods\";\"Many Periods\";\"Only Relative Differences Matter\";\"Relative and Absolute Differences Matter\";\"Only Relative Differences Matter\";\"Relative and Absolute Differences Matter\";\"Two Variable\";\"Three Variables\";\"Four Variables\";\"Visual by Components\";\"Canvas Chart\";\"Chart GL\";\"3D Charts\";\"Vega Charts\";\"Contour Charts\";\"Sunburst\";\"BiPartite Chart\";\"Graph\";\"Radial\";\"Treemap\";\"Features\";\"Interactive Features\";\"Pivot Queries\";\"Viewstates\";\"Zoom\";\"Hover\";\"Tooltips\";\"Regex\";\"Wildcard Columns\";\"Customisation\";\"Highlight Rules\";\"Many Categories\";\"Financial Chart\";\"Sparklines Grid\");icon:(\"fa fa-question-circle\";\"fa fa-exchange\";\"fa fa-sitemap\";\"fa fa-object-ungroup\";\"fa fa-link\";\"fa fa-clock-o\";\"fa fa-object-group\";\"fa fa-th\";\"fa fa-th-large\";\"fa fa-th-large\";\"fa fa-line-chart\";\"fa fa-pie-chart\";\"fa fa-bar-chart\";\"fa fa-line-chart\";\"fa fa-bar-chart\";\"fa fa-bar-chart\";\"fa fa-circle\";\"fa fa-ellipsis-h\";\"fa fa-area-chart\";\"fa fa-cubes\";\"fa fa-bar-chart\";\"fa fa-line-chart\";\"fa fa-bolt\";\"fa fa-clock-o\";\"fa fa-pie-chart\";\"fa fa-th\";\"fa fa-sitemap\";\"fa fa-th-large\";\"fa fa-th\";\"fa fa-bar-chart\";\"fa fa-bar-chart\";\"fa fa-area-chart\";\"fa fa-area-chart\";\"fa fa-ellipsis-h\";\"fa fa-circle\";\"fa fa-cubes\";\"fa fa-tachometer\";\"fa fa-bar-chart\";\"fa fa-ellipsis-h\";\"fa fa-cubes\";\"fa fa-line-chart\";\"fa fa-globe\";\"fa fa-sun-o\";\"fa fa-area-chart\";\"fa fa-sitemap\";\"fa fa-pie-chart\";\"fa fa-tree\";\"fa fa-hand-pointer-o\";\"fa fa-cogs\";\"fa fa-table\";\"fa fa-eye\";\"fa fa-search-plus\";\"fa fa-mouse-pointer\";\"fa fa-tag\";\"fa fa-asterisk\";\"fa fa-bar-chart\";\"fa fa-cog\";\"fa fa-lightbulb-o\";\"fa fa-table\";\"fa fa-usd\";\"fa fa-table\"))Generates this layout: |\n| Text | The data source column containing the label for each folder and item.

This data source is used to specify a connection between a pair of nodes using their unique identifier values. Each endpoint for a connection (edge) comes from a data source column. A unique identifier for each edge can be optionally specified.\n- Assign a column from theEdgesdata source to theFromproperty.\n- Assign a column from theEdgesdata source to theToproperty.\nRefer to a Graph component properties described in the next section for details on additional properties.\n\n## Graph component properties\n\nThe following sections provides details on how to configure the properties of the Graph component.\n\n### Basic\n\nThe\nBasic\nproperties, shown in the following image, are described below.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Name | Enter a name for the component. |\n| Selected Node | Specify aView State Parameterto store the unique identifier of the selected node(s). This is optional.Selecting a node: In Preview mode or the End-User version of the Dashboard, click on a node to assign a value to theSelected Nodeview state parameter. Use the Control key to make multiple selections. |\n| Selected Edge | Specify aView State Parameterto store the unique identifier of the selected edge(s). This is optional.Selecting an edge: In Preview mode or the End-User version of the Dashboard, click on an edge to assign a value to theSelected Edgeview state parameter. Use the Control key to make multiple selections. |\n\n\n### Data\n\nThis section identifies data source attributes that are used to define the nodes and edges. The following image shows the Graph's property section for Data.\n\n#### Nodes\n\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Source | TheData Sourcemust have at least two columns to define the node's unique identifier (ID) and text label. Each row in the data source is used to define a node.Data source results with the node ID and label |\n| Label | Data source column containing the text to be used for the nodes. |\n| ID (must be unique) | Data source column containing the unique ID for the nodes. |\n| Level (optional) | Data source column containing a numerical value that is used to specify the hierarchical position of the node.The following example shows a hierarchical layout oriented from left to right, with an added illustration to show the levels in pink |\n| Group (optional) | Data source column containing a group name to be associated with the node. As many as 21 superseding color sets are used to identify nodes in the same group.The following example illustrates a graph showing nodes belonging to 1 of 4 groups. |\n| Mass (optional) | Data source column used to specify the mass of the individual nodes. If no value is specified or the value is non-numeric, the minimum value of 1 is used. Larger values increase the repulsion effect for that specific node.To see the effect, this property requiresPhysicsto be enabled.In the example below, the node labeled 'Alexandra Pollie' has more mass and therefore, the repulsion effect is greater for that specific node, resulting in its further distance. |\n\n\n#### Node Color Sources\n\nThe data source for\nNodes\ncan specify the color attributes for each node. This method overrides the colors defined in the\nDefault Node Style\nsection.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Background Color | Data source column containing the background color of the nodes. |\n| Border Color | Data source column containing the border color of nodes. |\n\n\n##### Selected Node Color\n\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Background Color | Data source column containing the background color of the selected nodes. |\n| Border Color | Data source column containing the border color of the selected nodes. |\n\n\n##### Node Hover Color\n\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Background Color | Data source column containing the background color of the nodes when the user mouses over them. |\n| Border Color | Data source column containing the border color of the nodes when the user mouses over them. |\n\n\n#### Shape\n\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Custom Shape | The data source column containing the form the nodes takes. For example, circle, database, diamond, square, hexagon, triangle. |\n\n\n#### Edges\n\nThe edges show connections between nodes.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Source | ThisData Sourcemust return the columns to define the edge endpoints for the connection drawn between theFromandTonodes.The following example shows data source results with To and From columns. |\n| From | Data source column containing the node ID for the start of the edge. |\n| To | Data source column containing the node ID for the end of the edge. |\n| ID (optional) | Data source column containing the unique ID for the edges. |\n\n\n### Default Node Style\n\nThe following properties, shown in the image below, are used to style the nodes.\nThe border properties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Border Width | Specifies the thickness of the node border. |\n| Selected Border Width | Specifies the thickness of the selected node border. |\n\n\n#### Color\n\nThe following are the color properties of a node. Any of these color properties can be overridden if a data source column is used to define that color property in the\nNode Color Sources\nsection.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Background Color | Specifies the background color of the nodes. |\n| Border Color | Specifies the border color of the nodes. |\n\n\n##### Selected color\n\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Background Color | The background color of a node when it is selected. |\n| Border Color | The border color of a node when it is selected. |\n\n\n##### Hover color\n\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Background Color | The background color of the nodes when the user mouses over them. |\n| Border Color | The border color of the nodes when the user mouses over them. |\n\n\n### Default Edge Style\n\nThe following properties, shown in the image below, are used to style the edges.\nThe edge width properties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Edge Width | Specifies the thickness of the edge. |\n| Selected Edge Width | Specifies the thickness of the selected edge. |\n\n\n#### Arrows\n\nArrowheads can be added to the edge endpoints. The properties are described below.\n\n##### To\n\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Enabled | When checked, an arrowhead is added to theToside of the edge. |\n| Arrow Size | Specifies the size of theToarrowhead. |\n\n\n##### From\n\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Enabled | When checked, an arrowhead is added to theFromside of the edge. |\n| Arrow Size | Specifies the size of theFromarrowhead. |\n\n\n#### Color\n\nThe following properties are used to configure the color of the edges.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Edge Color | Specifies the color of the edge. |\n| Selected Edge Color | Specifies the color of the selected edge. |\n| Opacity | Defines the opacity of the edge with a value between 0 (transparent) and 1 (opaque). |\n\n\n### User Interaction\n\nThe\nUser Interaction\nproperties define how the user can interact with the graph. The properties are described in the table below.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Draggable Nodes | Allows the user to reposition nodes via click and drag. |\n| Draggable View | Allows the user to pan the graph image in different directions by clicking and dragging on an empty space in the graph. |\n| Select Connected Edges | Selects all edges for the selected node(s). |\n\n\n### Physics\n\nThis section contains properties used to influence and define the physical behavior of objects in the graph.\nThese properties are described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Enable Physics | When enabled, a physics algorithm is used to create the graph by simulating the physical properties of nodes and edges while also being affected by gravity.The image above shows graph behavior without physics, and the image below shows the graph with physics enabled. |\n| Max Steps Before Rendering | A step refers to a time duration where the position of one or more nodes may be affected by various forces (for example, gravity, edge stiffness) and potentially traveling some distance given its velocity. This property value refers to the maximum number of simulated steps taken before the graph is visible. |\n| Halt Physics After Rendering | This property determines whether physics continue after the graph has been rendered.When checked, after the initial rendering of the graph, the physics simulation is paused.When unchecked, physics continue to affect the layout of the graph until theMinimum Graph Speedhas been reached for all nodes.When unchecked, nodes repositioned by the user causes the physics simulation to continue until theMinimum Graph Speedhas been reached for all nodes. |\n| Minimum Graph Speed | Once the speed of all the nodes is less than or equal to the minimum graph speed no further steps are taken to affect the position of the nodes. |\n| Maximum Node Velocity | The maximum speed at which the nodes are allowed to move. This is a speed limit for the nodes. |\n| Anti-Gravity Constant | This value is used in a formula to quantify the effect of gravity for the nodes as if it were a repelling force. It represents the gravitational constant as a negative value. Higher values increase the repulsion effect and lower values approaching zero reduce it. |\n| Central Gravity Attractor | A force pulling the entire network towards the center of the graph.The higher the value, the stronger the pull towards the center.The lower the value, the weaker the attraction towards the center. |\n| Edge Length | The edges of the graph are modelled as springs and this value determines their length at rest. |\n| Edge Stiffness | The edges of the graph are modelled as springs. A larger value increases the minimum force required to affect the length of the edge. |\n\nWarning\nWhen\nPhysics\nand\nHierarchical Layout\nare both enabled, the node behavior associated with the hierarchical layout overrides the physics simulation.\n\n### Tooltips\n\nThe nodes in the graph can have tooltips. These properties are shown in the image below.\nThe\nTooltips\nProperty section is described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Show Tooltip | When checked, a tooltip is presented to the user when the mouse hovers over a node. |\n| Template | SeeTemplatesfor full details. |\n\n\n### Actions\n\nSee\nActions\nfor full details.\n\n### Layout\n\nThe\nLayout\nproperties, shown in the image below, are used to affect the arrangement of nodes and edges in the graph.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Random Layout Pattern | When checked, the initial position of the nodes and edges are different each time a new start position is required. Hierarchical layouts are not affected by this setting.The images above and below are for separate occurrences of the same data being used to render a graph with theRandom Layout Patternproperty checked. |\n| Layout Pattern | This numerical value is used to determine the initial layout of the graph. The results are consistent provided the data is unchanged. This does not apply to hierarchical layouts. |\n| Group Zoom Threshold | The graph component automatically zooms in/out when the window is resized and during the initial rendering so that all graph elements are within the visible boundary. The user can also manually zoom in/out by using the mouse wheel or the touchpad pinch-zoom input method. Zooming in increases the zoom level, and zooming out decreases it.TheGroup Zoom Thresholdis a number between 0 and 100 and it is used to identify a point for when the graph automatically transitions between showing individual nodes versus the individual groups for those nodes (groups appear as a circle shape).The graph's current zoom level is compared to theGroup Zoom Thresholdso that:If the graph's zoom level is greater than this value, the graph changes to show individual nodes.If the graph's zoom level is less than this value, the graph  changes to show individual groups.For example, for a given zoom level, if groups are displayed but the preference is to see individual nodes instead, the value of theGroup Zoom Thresholdmust be reduced.NoteUse of theGroup Zoom Thresholdrequires theGroupproperty to be defined. |\n\n\n#### Hierarchical\n\nThe following properties can be configured when using a hierarchical layout.\n\n| Property | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Enabled | When enabled, the nodes are arranged to show a parent-child relationship based on the node'sLevelattribute. |\n| Level Separation | Defines the height in pixels between levels. |\n| Node Spacing | Defines the width in pixels between nodes. |\n| Direction | This property is used to indicate the direction of the hierarchy as they appear starting from the Top level to the Bottom level. The options are:Left to Right,Right to Left,Up to Down, andDown to Up. |\n\n\n### Style, Margins, Format\n\nSee\nStyle\nfor full details of common settings.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- Navigate Dashboards workspace\n- Configure data source connections\n- Use view states\n- Publish & Export a dashboard",

    "text": "\n# Apply Templates\n\nThis page explains how to use templates in KX Dashboards to define reusable component structures with dynamic content.\nTemplates provide a way to reduce repetition and maintain consistent structures by combining a static definition with input-driven customization. Instead of defining a component directly, you can reference a template by name and pass in values through the inputs property.\n\n## Key Concepts\n\n- Template: A property used to reference a named template. The referenced content is inserted into the component at load time, allowing a consistent structure to be reused with different data or configuration. For example theTemplateproperty underData Grid/Tooltipcan be used to format the tooltip by referencing a template.\n- Template editor: The template editor supports a comprehensive suite of handlebars expressions.\n- Handlebar expressions: These include:arrays,comparisons,dates,math,miscellaneous,numbers,strings, andutilitiesand provide for rich, in-template data manipulation and rendering. Seesupported handlebar expressionsfor the full set.\n- Standard Template: KX Dashboards includes a built-in standard template. This allows developers to provide inputs and reuse the same component structure without needing to define a custom template name.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- Use Templates\n- Explore components\n- Connect data sources",

    "title": "Use View States",
    "text": "\n# Use View States\n\nThis page outlines the essential concepts you need to understand when working with view states in\nKX Dashboards\n.\nView States are dynamic variables that store values accessible across all components in a dashboard. They enable seamless interaction between user inputs, visual components, and data queries.\nBy leveraging view states, you can build highly interactive dashboards that respond to user input and reflect real-time or filtered data without manual reconfiguration.\n\n## What are view states?\n\nView States act as shared parameters that can:\n- Capture user input. For example, from dropdowns or text fields.\n- Pass values between components. For example, in a dashboard used by an FX analyst you could use a view state to pass a chosen currency pair from a dropdown to multiple components, such as charts, heatmaps, and news feeds. This keeps all components in sync, updating automatically based on the pair selected from the dropdown.\n- Dynamically update queries based on user interaction. For example, in a dashboard created for an operations analyst monitoring high-frequency trading data you could have a  time window selected by using a date range picker. This input updates view states likestartTimeandendTime, which are passed into queries powering a real-time trade volume chart and a latency heatmap. This automatically filters large volumes of records to show only the relevant slice of data.\nThese capabilities make dashboards more responsive, personalized, and efficient for data exploration and decision-making.\n\n## Creating and managing view states\n\nTo manage view states effectively in\nKX Dashboards\n, you can access the\nView State dialog\n, create new parameters with defined types and defaults, and organize them using folders for better structure\n- Access the View State dialog via the eye icon at the top of the properties panel or in any property that it appears.\n- Create new view states by specifying a name, data type (for example, string, int, datetime), and optional default value.\n- Use folders to organize view states and manage them efficiently.\n\n## Use view states in queries\n\nView states can be integrated into queries, enabling dynamic filtering and interaction based on user input.\n- Inkdb+/q, view states can be passed as function parameters or embedded directly in queries using <%param%> syntax.\n- InSQL, use {{param}} to inject view state values into queries.\n- View states can bemapped to query results, enabling dynamic filtering and interactivity.\n\n## View state types and features\n\nView states offer flexible data handling, dynamic time-based updates, and tools to keep your dashboard configuration clean and efficient.\n- The support a wide range of data types including lists, timestamps, and symbols.\n- Rolling View Statesallow time-based values to update dynamically. For example, current minute or day.\n- Unused view statescan be cleaned up to maintain clarity.\n\n## Visualize view state relationships\n\nThe View State dialog includes a\ngraph view\nshowing how each view state connects to components and data sources.\nComponents can be renamed for clarity in the graph.\n\n## Further reading\n\n- Explore components\n- Connect data sources\n- Use view state parameters",

    "text": "\n# Use Actions\n\nThis page introduces the concept of Actions in\nKX Dashboards\n, explaining how user-triggered events like clicks or selections can drive dynamic interactions to create responsive and interactive dashboards.\nActions in\nKX Dashboards\nare mechanisms that enable user interactions to trigger specific changes or workflows in the dashboard. They are used to build dynamic, responsive, and interactive dashboards. Actions allow dashboard components to communicate and react to user behavior, such as clicking a button, selecting a row in a table, or changing a dropdown value.\nFor example, you can configure a table row selection to update another panel with details, or trigger a query when a filter value changes. This level of interactivity is essential for building real-time, data-driven applications.\nBy leveraging actions effectively, you can design dashboards that not only display data but also respond intelligently to user input.\n\n## Action Types\n\nKX Dashboards supports multiple types of actions, each tied to specific events and components. Some common types include:\n- View state mapping: Maps values ofView State parametersfrom the source dashboard to View State parameters in the destination Dashboard.\n- Open Dashboard/Screen: Opens a specified dashboard or screen.\n- Run Query: Executes a data query based on an event, for example, button press.\n- Open URL: Redirects to a different page or tab.\n- Apply Rolling Syntax/View State: If a view state hasrolling syntax, this action updates the view states's value using the rolling syntax.\n\n## Event Triggers\n\nEach action is triggered by a user event. Typical event types include:\n- mouse in\n- mouse out\n- click\n- double-click\n- right-click\n- hover\n\n### Configuration\n\nActions are configured using the properties panel in the dashboard editor of\ncomponents that support actions\n. You can:\n- Choose the component and event to listen to.\n- Define what the action should do.\n- Chain multiple actions to build workflows.\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- Navigate Dashboards workspace\n- Explore Dashboards components\n- Connect data sources",

To apply a border, set Border Size to a value greater than 1.Border Spacingsets the distance between the border and the inner component. |\n| Worksheet Padding | Padding in pixels around each component |\n| Show Loading Indicators | When dashboard sends a request for data, a spiral \"loading\" indicator appears on screen until data is uploaded.TipIf your dashboard uses streaming, managed or polling data, uncheckShow Loading Indicators. |\n\n\n### Logo\n\nA simple image logo can be added to a dashboard using a\nText Input\ncomponent.\n- Drag the Text Input component into the dashboard, then select it.\n- Click inside the Formatted Text box of the Basics properties to open the editor.\n- Use the menu bar to add an image.Ensure your logo image uses a transparent background â to be compatible with the background of the dashboard.\n- Set the height and width of the logo in pixels.Tip50 pixels is a good height for a logo. The importer re-scales the logo maintaining its aspect ratio if only the image height is set.\n- Delete the defaultinsert text herebefore adding the logo.\n- If your logo is positioned to the left of the dashboard, change theHorizontalalignment toLeft. (Vice versa for right-positioned logos.)\n- Prevent the appearance of unnecessary scroll bars around the logo on browser resize: updateAdvanced CSSfrom theStylemenu.Click the CSS icon to activate the selector.Roll over the component until thediv.htmlContentbox is selected:Amend the CSS to hide scroll bars: set theoverflowproperty tohidden. (Remember to add the CSS inside the{}brackets.)\nTip\nIf dashboard styling is used to align and position components, remember to update the\nMargins\nsetting of the\nText Input\ncomponent to undo any unnecessary changes to the position of the logo.\n\n## Component style\n\nSome style settings common to many components.\n\n### Title\n\nControls title positioning relative to the component pane and outer border\n\n| Sample title settings | Results |\n| --- | --- |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n|  |  |\n\nAdjusting\nTitle Left\nand\nTitle Right\nwill add margin even if the title is center-aligned by\nTitle Horizontal Align\nin the\nFormat dialog\n.\n\n### Margins\n\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Outer margins | Spacing in pixels outside of component and component border |\n| Inner margins | Spacing in pixels between the rectangular component area and any utilized border. |\n\nTip\nIn the absence of a defined border, changes between inner and outer margins will appear similar.\nAdded widget spacing is the equivalent of outer margins in the\nMargins\nmenu of a component.\nBorder Spacing\nsets the spacing between the elements of the component and the border.\nBorder Spacing\nis the equivalent of inner margins in the Margins menu of a component.\nRounding of borders is possible only if\nBorder Size\nhas a value greater than 1. Use of more rounded borders requires increased border spacing to avoiding edge cutting of the border.\nTip\nDashboard margin settings override component margin settings. When styling dashboards, set margins at the dashboard level before setting them for individual components.\n\n### Format\n\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Title |  |\n| Title Font Size | In pixels |\n| Title Font Color | Click on the color bar to bring up the palette menu. |\n| Title Bold |  |\n| Title Shadow | When checked, applies shadow to the title |\n| Title Horizontal Align | Horizontal position of the title within component |\n| Title Bottom Border Size | Pixel distance between the title and the component content |\n| Border and background color | Component Coloris the color of the componentâs border and title background whenTransparent Backgroundis unchecked |\n| Border Size, Rounding and Color | These three parameters control the borders of a component:TipAdjust Inner Top and Inner Bottom margins if necessary to avoid the rectangular box of the component cutting into a rounded border. |\n| Component Shadow | A Bar Chart with a component shadow |\n\n\n### Palette Theme\n\nPalette Theme\n\n### Palettes\n\nPalettes\n\n### Advanced CSS\n\nClick inside the Advanced CSS editor. Click the selector icon, then inside the chart component to edit CSS rules.\n- Click inside the Advanced CSS editor\n- Click the Element selector.\n- Use the selector to point at the area of the component to change. The editor will automatically detect and assign the relevant widget ID and reference CSS - all thatâs needed is the custom content, e.g. color, background-color etc.\n- Apply the changes\nTip\nAny Advanced CSS component can be used to define the CSS for any component in a dashboard, all that's required is the correct Widget ID.\nUse Chrome Developer Tools, Elements Inspector to source the Widget ID. Select an element with the Developer Tool pointer directing it on the component in the Dashboard. This will focus the Elements content on the component HTML. Associated CSS will be displayed in the right column and widget ID in the main pane.\n\n### Customizing Error Messages\n\nError messages defined by\ncssClass:\"..\":\ncan be styled in the\nAdvanced CSS editor\n; for example:\nq\nCopy\n\n```\n'\"cssClass:\\\"criticalError\\\":Invalid parameter!\"\n```\n\nwould use the CSS format\nCSS\nCopy\n\n```\n[data-widgetid=\"widgetIdGuid\"] .criticalError .statusText {    font-size: 60px;    color: red !important;}\n```\n\nin the Advanced CSS editor.\n\n### CSS classes\n\nCSS classes can be used to style components.

    "text": "\n# Layout Panel\n\nThis page describes the Layout Panel component and how it can be set up and configured.\nLayout panels are used to nest components within the dashboard. You can add them to any panel component or directly to the dashboard itself.\nLayout Panels are best used within\nFlex Panel\n,\nTab Control\nand\nAccordion\ncomponents or to create elements like navigation menus.\nYou can add any component to a Layout Panel. The following example shows a Layout Panel with multiple Chart GL components.\nThis page provides information on the following:\n- Setting up a Layout Panel\n- Basic properties\nFor details on common properties used by this component refer to the following:\n- Style properties\n- Margins properties\n- Format properties\n\n## Set up a layout panel\n\nTo set up a Layout Panel:\n- Click and drag a Layout Panel into the workspace.\n- Click and drag a component to the Layout Panel. This fills the area of the Layout panel, but can be resized to add additional components.\n- To add additional components, click and drag them from the left-hand panel and drop them within the boundary of the Layout Panel.\n- Refer to Layout Panel properties described in the next section for details on additional properties.\n\n## Layout Panel properties\n\nThe following sections provides details on how to configure the properties of the Layout Panel component.\n\n### Basics\n\nOpen the Basics properties on the right and configure the properties described in the following table.\n\n| Property | Description | Default |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Name | Enter a name for the component. | Blank |\n| Fill Height | When checked, this auto sizes nested components to fill the height of the Layout panel. If this is uncheckedRow CountbecomesRow Height.  It is recommended to enable this after adding all required components to the panel | Checked |\n| Advanced Layout | This is used to best-fit components according to panel width. Components stack on resizing.CSS can be used to position components and use fixed-sizing to prevent component resizing on changes in browser width. Use.advanced-item[data-widgetid=\"xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx\"] {}to configure Advanced Layout CSS.When bothFill HeightandAdvanced Layoutare enabled, onlyAdvanced Layoutrules applies. | Checked |\n| User Layout | This allows for user arrangement of components. When checked, users can add, remove and reposition components. Refer toUser Layoutfor further details. | Unchecked |\n| Floatable | When enabled, an added component snaps to the nearest row anchor. Otherwise, the component always snaps to the top row. | Checked |\n| Enable WebGL Context | When enabled, every ChartGL widget that is directly added to the Layout Panel shares a single WebGL context. | Unchecked |\n| Column Count/Row Count/Row Height | These define the Layout Panel grid size. Components added are locked in position to this grid. The grid is visible when a component is dragged into position.Row Heightis displayed whenFill Heightis unchecked. This is the height in pixels between each grid row.The number of grid rows used is defined by the priorRow Countvalue; for example ifRow Countis 30 andRow Heightis set to 30; then the distance from top to bottom - in the absence ofFill Height- is 900 pixels; that is 30 x 30.If the pixel height is greater than the browser height, a scroll bar appears and some components may be positioned off-screen. |  |\n| Expand Widgets | This controls whether users can expand and collapse widgets within the Layout Panel. The options are:None: The expand button is not displayed.Fill Dashboard: The expand button is displayed, and when clicked the widget fills the entire dashboard.Fill Panel: The expand button is displayed, and when clicked the widget fills the space of the Layout Panel.The following screenshot shows a Layout Panel with six ChartGL components withExpand Widgetset toFill Panel.In Preview mode you can see that each widget has an expand icon in the top right-hand corner of the widget.When you click on the expand icon the widget expands to fill the entire panel, as shown below. | None |\n| Repeatable | This checkbox enables or disables therepeatable panelfeature. When checked, the Layout Panel is duplicated based on theRepeatable ViewStateparameter.Note that you can edit only the child contents of repeatable panel when this property is unchecked.Refer toRepeatable Panelsfor further information on using this feature. |  |\n| Repeatable Viewstate | This view state defines the list of values used to generate multiple repeating panels. Each value is passed as an input into the corresponding repeating panel instance. The number of repeating panels corresponds to the length of this list. |  |\n\nTip\nAuto size components\nUnless you have a reason to lock the size of components dropped into a Layout panel, check both\nFill Height\nand\nAdvanced Layout\n. This ensures the components in your Layout panel auto size along with the Accordion or Tab Control section that contains it. Refer to\nBasics\nfor further information about these properties.\n\n### Style, Margins, Format\n\nRefer to\nStyle\nfor common Style, Margins and Format settings.\n\n## Customize User Layout\n\nYou can configure the Layout Panel to allow users to customize the layout. This is done by enabling\nUser Layout\nin the\nBasics\nproperties. Once the Dashboard is save users can do the following:\n- ClickOpen Viewer, in theUser Menu, shown below, to open the dashboard in a new window.\n- Click theCustomise Dashboardicon, as shown below. This adds aComponent Layouticon to the top right-hand corner of the panel\n- The components are now movable and can be repositioned. The following shows the position of the components has been swapped around.\n- Components can be deleted.\n- Components that have been removed (and hidden) can be returned (or included) by clicking on theComponent Layoutbutton and selecting them from the list. Components are identified by their title, user-defined name or component type, and in that order of preference. ClickingReset Layoutrestores the layout of the components to their original state.\n- Once complete, click the settings icon\n- Click theSave Viewstateicon to save the new layout.\n\n## Repeatable Panels\n\nRepeatable Panels offer a scalable and efficient way to dynamically generate multiple instances of a layout or visualization based on a list of values from the view state. Instead of manually duplicating and configuring panels for each data item, you define a single panel once and mark it as repeatable.\nWhen a panel is\nset to repeat\n, the\nKX Dashboards\nautomatically renders a copy of that panel for each item in the specified view state list. Each repeated instance inherits the panel's layout and configuration, but is contextually bound to the current value from the list enabling tailored views or visualizations for each data slice.\nThis feature enhances scalability and consistency in\nKX Dashboards\n, especially when visualizing metrics across multiple entities, such as instruments, regions, or devices.\n\n### Benefits\n\n- Reduces duplication: No need to copy/paste the same panel multiple times for different values.\n- Dynamic dashboards: Autokmatically adjusts to changes in the view state list, such as  newly added symbols or regions.\n- Consistency: Ensures uniform styling and behavior across all repeated panels.\n- Efficiency: Makes dashboards easier to maintain, extend, and understand.\n\n### Use cases\n\nUse repeatable panels when:\n- You need to display the same visualization or layout across multiple items (for example, one chart per symbol, or one table per region).\n- The list of items may change dynamically, and you want your dashboard to adjust without manual edits.\n- You want to compare items side-by-side in a consistent format.\n- You need to reduce maintenance overhead, since updating one panel updates all repeated instances.\n\n### Enabling repeatable panels\n\nTo configure a panel as repeatable:\n- Open the Layout Panels Basics properties.\n- EnableRepeatable Panels.\n- Define theRepeatable Viewstate.\n\n### Writing queries for repeatable components\n\nTo make a q query repeatable:\n- Insert the variable$repeatViewstateinto your q query.At runtime,$repeatViewstateis replaced with each value from theRepeatable Viewstatelist, generating one query per value.\n- The following example query is described in the next section.Copyselect [5] by time from dfxQuote where sym = $repeatViewstate\n\n#### Example\n\nThis example shows a Layout Panel containing two ChartGL components that are repeated for each currency pair selected from the dropdown list.\nThis is configured as follows:\n- The Dashboard has been configured with:A Layout Panel containing two ChartGL components; one for Bid and one for AskA Drop Down List component from which the currency pairs are selected and passed to theselectedview state. This view state determines how often the panels are repeated.Note that the ChartGL components can be edited only when Repeatable is unchecked.\n- The Data Source for the ChartGL/Layer/Bid Size is set to the following query:\n- Theselectedview state list is set in theData Sourcefor the Drop Down List component. This view state determines how many times the panel is repeated and what values each instance uses.At runtime, the repeatable panel expands into multiple instances: one for each item selected from the dropdown list. The example at the top of this section shows three pairs selected, resulting in three ChartGL panels.Each instance substitutes the$repeatViewstatewith a specific value, for example:select [5] by time from dfxQuote where sym = `$\"EUR/USD\"select [5] by time from dfxQuote where sym = `$\"GBP/EUR\"select [5] by time from dfxQuote where sym = `$\"JPY/EUR\"\n\n## Further Reading\n\n- Navigate Dashboards workspace\n- Configure data source connections\n- Use view states\n- Publish & Export a dashboard",

The following screenshot illustrates an Action Tracker with horizontal layout\n[CDATA[      ]]\n\n## Set up an Action Tracker\n\nTo set up an Action Tracker, click-and-drag the component into the workspace and configure the Action Tracker properties described in the next section.\n\n## Action Tracker properties\n\nThe following sections provides details on how to configure the properties of the Action Tracker component.\n\n### Basics\n\nOpen the Basics properties on the right and configure the properties described in the following table.\n\n| Field | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Name | A name for the component provided by the user. |\n| Data Connection/Streaming Data Connection | Refer toData sourcesfor details about setting up a connection.Data ConnectionNoteData connectionThe connection is a very specific alert gateway process, querying real-time and historical alerts. Alerts are published into a fixed tabledxATAlertand the displayed table is kept indxATItemCurrent. AData Sourceis not needed as all modification of the view lies withinKX Dashboards.You can tick/untick the visible columns in the Style editor. There are some miscellaneous columns (tag1,tag2, etc.) that you can populate freely and then change the column header withinKX Dashboardsif you want more customised information in your alert table. |\n| Layout split | Select eitherVerticalorHorizontal. |\n| Show Row Count | Displays the number of data rows. |\n| Custom Layout | Select display columns from available data columns.

(Case) | Specify HTML Templates forAlert Title,Alert DetailsandAlert Dialog, andHandlebarhelpers to map data into the template.The Action Tracker has the following HandleBars helper function:formatTimeStampsThis finds all kdb timestamps in a given string and converts them to a different format. If the date format parameter is omitted, the default conversion format isYYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSSSS. The resulting value outputs the date and time based on the timezone setting in the Dashboard.Parameters:string{String}: The string containing kdb timestamps.date format{String}: Optional. The date format used for conversion. Refer tomomentfor available formats.Returns {String}: The string containing the converted date formatsExample:HandlebarsCopy{{formatTimeStamps\"Sample date: 2019.12.31D15:30:11.000000000\"\"MM-DD-YYYY HH:mm:ss.SS\"}}<!-- resultsin:\"Sample date: 12-31-2019 15:30:11.00\"iftimezone is set to UTC --><!-- resultsin:\"Sample date: 12-31-2019 10:30:11.00\"iftimezone is set to New York --><!-- resultsin:\"Sample date: 01-01-2020 00:30:11.00\"iftimezone is set to Tokyo --> |\n| Alert Details Template |\n| Alert Details Templ.
