Change to a single data model with many entry points, so you pick the language and keep the speed without ETL, adapters, or schema translation.\nq\n\n```\nIn q: \n\nq)tab:([] sym: 5?`AAPL`MSFT; qty: 1 + 5?100; prices: 100 * 5?1f) \n\nq)s)SELECT * FROM tab WHERE sym='AAPL' \n \n======================================================= \n\n# Or, with Python  \ntable = kx.Table(  \n\n  data = {'sym': kx.random.random(5, ['AAPL', 'MSFT']),  \n\n          'size': 1+kx.random.random(5, 100), \n\n          'prices': kx.random.random(5, 100.0)}) \n\n ======================================================= \n\nQuery with SQL \n\nkx.q.sql(\"SELECT * FROM $1 WHERE sym=$2\", table, \"AAPL\") \n```\n\nUse Parquet With Ease\n\n### Zero-copy queries on open-format data\n\nTreat Parquet as a first-class table: load, read, select. Query lake data in place with q/SQL or Python on the same engine. Open format, zero-copy interoperability across object storage means no ETL, adapters, or conversion, delivering a familiar developer experience and faster time to value from a simpler, integrated stack for real-time analytics and AI.\nq\n\n```\n/ Load the parquet module \n\nq)([pq]):use`kx.pq \n\n/ Read the fx_quote parquet file into a table \n\nq)fx_quote:pq `:fx_quote.parquet \n\n/ Query the fx_quote table \n\nq)10#select symbol, ask_price, bid_price, ask_volume, bid_volume from fx_quote\n```\n\nLeverage Modules: AI Libraries\n\n### Query across structured and unstructured with AI libs\n\nBuilt-in AI libraries bring vector and time series similarity search into q/Python on the same in-memory engine, so you pattern match in place (e.g., DTW) with no data movement or separate ML stack.\nq\n\n```\n/load AI Libs module \n\nq).ai:use`kx.ai \n\n/Create a time series to search against \n\nq)ts: neg[5.0] + 1000?10.0; \n\n/Create a query vector to search against the time series

Axi takes pride in truly understanding their customer’s needs and are dedicated to faster execution and improved risk management. Axi’s commitment draws on investments made in new products, new technology, to strengthen its global presence, and to help sharpen their trading capabilities for 60,000 traders in 100+ countries.\n\n## The challenge\n\nAxi needed to find a solution that was able to capture, analyze, and visualize streaming data in real-time and at scale.\nTo support their trading, operations, and risk management teams, up-to-date business intelligence reports and analytics were essential. Ultimately, the challenge was finding the right technology with the ability to capture a large dataset including market data quotes, customer trades, and derived calculations in an efficient and reliable way that would grow the business.\n\n## Why KX?\n\nKX presented a unique offering with ultra real-time streaming analytics, visualization, and historical analysis that provided fast prototyping and deployment in a single technology stack.\nThis combination led Axi to start using KX in 2015. KX enabled Axi to capture a large dataset on a very small hardware footprint, whilst generating key reports on real-time positions, perform risk analysis, and provide insights for the trading desks at a low TCO.\nAs the company continued to grow, they expanded the solution with\nKX Dashboards\n, which provided the capability for dashboards and visualizations to be configured across both historical and streaming real-time data; other common visualization tools evaluated could only provide historical or batch analysis.\nFurther expansion of the business needs and use cases meant that Axi needed to grow and scale their KX infrastructure on their chosen cloud provider, Azure.\nkdb Insights\nwas the obvious choice given the ability to deliver efficient and time sensitive data processing in real-time natively in the cloud for its growing FX business.\nExplore how KX is optimizing trading, risk analytics, and decision-making forfinancial services

    "text": "\n# kdb+\n\nkdb+ is the world’s fastest, high-performance time-series database and analytics engine, powered by the vector language q. For over 30 years, it has delivered ultra-low latency access to real-time and historical data across Capital Markets, Defense, and High-Tech Manufacturing.\nkdb+ runs directly on the CPU for the fastest possible execution.\n\n## From Passion To Powering The Planet’s Most Critical Data\n\nkdb+ is the world’s fastest time-series database and analytics engine, built to capture, analyze, and act on data in motion. Created by computer scientist\nArthur Whitney,\na pioneer in high-performance programming languages, it began as a passion project in pursuit of speed and simplicity.\nToday, kdb+ powers the world’s most data-intensive systems, from global financial markets to aerospace and advanced manufacturing. Combining Whitney’s elegant\nq language\nwith a robust in-memory architecture, kdb+ enables organizations to process massive volumes of streaming and historical data in real time, all within a single, unified environment.\n\n## The Art of Compute Efficiency\n\nkdb+’s benchmark-leading performance is the result of its thoughtfully engineered development. It leverages the CPU, memory, and storage to work in perfect harmony.\nThe Software\n– The entire system is less than 1 MB and fits directly in the CPU’s cache, meaning instructions don’t have to wait to load, unlike on other platforms with heavier stacks like Postgres or Java. With no additional layers introducing abstraction, you get the fastest possible execution for any query.\nThe Language\n– kdb+ has its own unique language, q, specifically built for kdb+. It is lean by design and delivers a smaller, faster interaction with kdb+ data than C, Python, or SQL. As an array-based language, q treats datasets as vectors rather than individual rows, enabling quick scans across billions of records with no latency between thought and computation.\nThe Orchestration\n– Data stored in kdb+ is columnar and time-series by nature, so only the relevant columns are read for the selected time slices, dramatically reducing I/O and processing time. With a unified language and engine specifically built to handle time-series data, unnecessary layers across your data analytics are eliminated.\nEverything about kdb+’s design, from its language to its architecture, is built for efficiency, simplicity, and raw performance.\n\n## Core Advantages of kdb+\n\n\n### Cache-Aware Execution\n\nSmall memory footprint and L1/L2 locality minimize data movement for ultra-low latency.\n\n### Multiple languages\n\nSupports our native language q, as well as Python, Java, C#, C++, Rust, R, and open-source libraries.\n\n### Time-Series Native\n\nBuilt-in functions and temporal datatypes (incl. nanosecond timestamps) simplify time-based analytics.\n\n### High Performance at Scale\n\nColumnar, in-memory, and parallel execution deliver low-latency analytics on massive data.\n\n### Real-Time & Historical\n\nProcess streaming and stored data together for rapid, informed decisions.\n\n### Cost-Efficient\n\nLower TCO with storage/compute optimized for time-series and high-throughput workloads.\n\n## In-Memory Processing forSub-Millisecond Insight\n\nkdb+ ingests and analyzes real-time data directly in memory, removing disk latency and accelerating time to insight. By working entirely in RAM, it delivers sub-millisecond performance for time-critical workloads such as trading, fraud detection, and IoT monitoring. Live data is instantly available for analysis, enabling users to query and act on information as it arrives.\n\n### Intelligent storage keeps performance high & costs low\n\n- As data moves from memory to disk, kdb+ automatically shifts it between storage tiers without affecting access or speed.\n- This seamless data lifecycle keeps hot data in RAM and colder data on disk, balancing low-latency performance with long-term scalability.\n- The result is consistent query speed and optimized infrastructure costs, even at the petabyte scale.\n\n### Tiered databases deliver speed and scalability\n\n- The Real-Time Database (RDB) holds the newest, high-frequency data in memory for sub-millisecond queries.\n- The Intraday Database (IDB) stores recent data on disk in small time partitions for efficient access and minimal memory pressure.\n- The Historical Database (HDB) archives long-term data in a columnar format for backtesting, compliance, and analytics at scale.\n\n### Memory mapping eliminates I/O bottlenecks\n\n- kdb+ maps disk files directly into memory, eliminating the need for costly read/write operations and data translation.\n- This architecture allows the CPU to access stored data as if it were already in RAM, dramatically cutting I/O overhead.\n- Combined with in-database compute, queries run at near-memory speed across all tiers, delivering real-time results to the client.\n\n## Built for themost demandingenvironments, kdb+ holds15 of 17 STAC-M3* world records.\n\nRead Benchmarks Report\n98%\nFastest query times across audited STAC-M3 tests\n36%\nLower latency under 100-user workloads\n1.6 PiB\nTested storage — over 6× larger than prior record\n19/24\nRecord-breaking results in STAC-M3 Kanaga meant time response benchmarks\n*“STAC” and all STAC names are trademarks or registered trademarks of the Securities Technology Analysis Center, LLC.”\n\n## kdb+ Powered Products\n\n\n### KDB-X\n\nA unified stack for Time Series, Vector Data, and AI Workloads:\n- Natively query Parquet and kdb+ data together with q, Python, and SQL in one environment\n- Speed up compute-heavy operaitons with GPU Acceleration(Spring ’26).\n- Build AI Solutions AI Libraries for better search and link to popular LLMs with MCP Server\nLearn More\n\n### kdb Insights\n\nCloud-native and on-premises analytics platform\nLearn More\n\n### \n\n\n### KX Delta\n\nReal-time data streaming for the defense industry\nLearn More\n\n### KX Sensors\n\nLarge-Volume streaming for IoT and OEM industry\nLearn More\n\n### \n\n\n### KDB.AI\n\nVector database designed for analytics and AI\nLearn More\n\n## kdb+’s q Language Delivers Speed\n\nThe q language transforms kdb+ from a traditional database into a high-performance compute engine. Built for speed, precision, and simplicity, q combines vectorized execution, functional design, and temporal intelligence to deliver real-time insight from massive datasets.\n\n### Vector processing eliminates looping inefficiencies\n\n- Traditional databases process data row by row, which slows performance as datasets grow.\n- q uses vectorized execution, applying operations to entire arrays at once via SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data).\n- This reduces the need for explicit loops and lets the CPU process millions of data points simultaneously.\nVectorized processing lets q handle massive datasets in memory with minimal overhead.\n\n## Related content\n\nDeveloper\n\n### Supercharge hardware evaluation with KX Nano: An open-source benchmark tool\n\nDeveloper\n\n### Tick
