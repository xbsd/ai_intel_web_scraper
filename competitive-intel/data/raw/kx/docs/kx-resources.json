And the momentum is far from slowing down. Over the next 12 months, 35% expect their organizations to increase spending by at least 20%, while 17% anticipate growth of more than 40%.\nThis acceleration shows that firms are not just experimenting but embedding AI into the heart of their business strategies. As these investments expand, the firms that prioritize real-time data, trusted infrastructure, and scalable platforms will be positioned to turn spending into measurable advantage.\n\n### The main data challenges faced impacting continued investment in innovation:\n\n40%\nEnsuring data quality\n35%\nEnsuring data integrity\n33%\nGovernance concerns\n\n## AI is a booster\n\nQuants report a 62% productivity gain from AI.\nAlmost every quant surveyed acknowledges that AI has enhanced their effectiveness, helping them move faster and deliver greater value to their organizations.\nThe impact goes beyond time saved; it includes sharper decision-making, reduced manual and repetitive work, and the ability to optimize strategies with higher accuracy and personalization. These gains are compounding as firms refine their AI approaches.\nBy freeing analysts to focus on innovation and insight, AI is enabling the discovery of new signals, smarter trading decisions, and a greater ability to anticipate risk. For many, it already feels less like a tool and more like a competitive multiplier.\n\n### However, quants cite the following as blockers to experimenting with GenAI in their role:\n\n38%\nNot a strategic priority yet\n32%\nLack of expertise/talent\n27%\nInfrastructure/data readiness\n\n## Analysts are pushing technology boundaries\n\n70% of quants want more advanced technology for real-time data analysis and decision-making .\nTheir expectations reflect both the critical nature of their role and the pace at which markets evolve. Quants are clear: access to the right technology can mean the difference between leading and lagging. They want platforms that can handle vast data sets at low latency, provide reliable infrastructure for experimentation, and give them confidence in compliance.\nWith so much at stake, quants are also asking for a stronger voice in technology choices, ensuring their needs are heard and acted upon. Organizations that empower them are not only giving their teams the best chance to succeed but also creating a culture where innovation becomes part of the competitive DNA.\n81%\nOf quants want more influence over tech choices\n24%\nSay a fully in-house AI stack would make them more effective\n48%\nSay current GenAI solutions ‘feel limited’\n\n## IT at risk of being overwhelmed\n\n66% of CIOs and CDAOs feel overwhelmed by analyst demands for AI and innovation.\nWhile most (65%) tech leaders prioritize innovation over risk reduction, the pressure is mounting. Shadow AI, compliance concerns, and escalating performance demands are putting even mature organizations under strain. But there is mutual recognition for the challenges faced between the front and back office.\n- 75% of IT and data leaders say analysts are demanding access to new AI technology and tools faster than they can deliver them\n- 87% of technology leaders believe that shadow-AI initiatives could put their business at risk\n- 73% of quants acknowledge that IT leaders are in a difficult position\n\n## A clear competitive advantage\n\nAligning analysts and IT can deliver a 6.6-month edge over the competition.\nThat extra time gives firms the ability to test new strategies, refine models, and seize opportunities before the competition even reacts. The advantage is already being realized by organizations that reduce friction between quants and IT and embed collaboration into their operating model.\nWith stronger infrastructure, shared goals, and unified data strategies, these firms move with greater speed and confidence. Analysts gain the tools and trusted data they need to innovate, while CIOs and CDAOs ensure resilience, security, and governance. Together, this alignment turns AI from isolated pilots into enterprise-wide systems that scale effectively, creating an advantage that compounds over time.\n\n## Download the report\n\nUnlock the full report to discover how quants and tech leadership are building momentum together.\nDownload here\n.entry-content\n#post-##",

    "text": "Volatility isn’t the problem — it’s the proving ground.\nIn this closing keynote, Peter Finter, Chief Marketing Officer at KX, challenges how capital markets think about volatility, AI, and performance under pressure. As alpha windows shrink and market tempo accelerates, the firms that thrive are those who can turn volatility into opportunity — with the speed, trust, and scale to act in real time.\nDrawing on insights from the 2025 Capital Markets Data Report and stories from leaders like Treehouse Labs, Guggenheim, B2C2, and MFS, Peter explores the three shifts separating leaders from laggards:\n- From Models to Market Timing — collapsing the loop from idea to execution.\n- From Fragmentation to Awareness — unifying structured and unstructured data for a full-market view.\n- From Speed to Durable Speed — building performance that’s explainable, auditable, and resilient under pressure.\nPlus, a bonus shift — from friction to alignment — showing how quants, CIOs, and data teams can finally move in sync to capture continuous advantage.\nThis is more than a talk about AI potential. It’s a roadmap for performance in practice — for firms ready to compete, adapt, and win in the new volatility era.\n\n## Related content\n\nPodcast\n\n### Ashok Reddy on why temporal AI is the next

    "text": "In this fireside chat at the KX Capital Markets Summit in London, Kimiya Minoukadeh, Global Head of Quant Trading at ING, shares their multi-year transformation journey and how KX has become a core part of their trading, risk, and analytics ecosystem. They discuss how ING evolved from using kdb+ as a quant tool to embedding it across FX, fixed income, equities, sales, and risk—enabling real-time monitoring, deeper insights, and organization-wide data democratization.\nThe session explores how ING brought asset classes together on a unified data platform, how AI and reinforcement learning models dramatically improved FX pricing, and how traders themselves began engaging directly with data through KX dashboards and Q queries. They also highlight the cultural shift, infrastructure evolution, and stability gains needed to operate reliably in highly volatile markets.\nLooking ahead, ING outlines the opportunities of agentic AI, natural language access to kdb+ data, and using unstructured data—from chat flows to alt data sets—to enhance trading and client insight. This conversation offers a rare inside look at how a global bank modernized its analytics, embraced AI, and laid the foundation for the next generation of data-driven decision-making using KX technology.\n\n## Related content\n\neBook\n\n### AI in capital markets: Drive transformative value with five real-world use cases\n\nFinancial services\n\n### E-trading’s evolution isn’t just a

    "title": "Signal Decay: Why Alpha Half-Lives Are Shrinking and How Leading Funds Keep Up | KX",
    "text": "Recent periods of elevated volatility, rapid shifts in liquidity, and changing correlation structures have highlighted how quickly market conditions can evolve. In this environment, many alpha signals are decaying faster than in prior cycles as market structure, automation, and competitive dynamics continue to compress effective strategy lifespans.\nShorter regime stability and increased sensitivity to timing and execution mean that signal degradation is often detected late—frequently after capital has been deployed and opportunity cost has already accrued.\nThis session examines how hedge funds are responding to that environment, and why the ability to understand change quickly has become a decisive factor in maintaining alpha.\nIn this webinar, we explore:\n- How signal behavior evolves under live market conditions\n- Why detection lag now carries direct P&L and capital allocation impact\n- Where value is lost quietly through delayed activation or late retirement of strategies\n- How portfolio interaction amplifies small signal-level changes\n- Which analytical capabilities shorten the time from exposure to understanding\nThe focus is on navigating signal decay with greater clarity and control as markets continue to evolve.\n\n### Who Should Attend\n\nThis session is designed for professionals responsible for building, evaluating, or operating quantitative strategies, including:\n- Heads of Quant Research and Systematic Trading\n- Portfolio Managers and Desk Leads\n- Senior Quant Researchers and Data Scientists\n- Trading Technology, Architecture, and Engineering Leads\n\n### Speakers\n\nPaul Geis\nAccount Director, KX\nPaul is a financial services sales leader with more than 23 years of experience working with investment banks, hedge funds, and trading firms. He brings deep domain expertise across algorithmic trading, transaction cost analysis, smart order routing, execution, and trade surveillance, and has spent his career partnering closely with front-office, quant, and technology leaders.\nScott Rich\nSoftware Architecture Consultant\nScott recently retired after nearly a decade at a leading US hedge fund, where he served as Managing Director and Head of Architecture. He brings close to 40 years of experience in large-scale software systems, including prior roles as a Distinguished Engineer at IBM working on software lifecycle tools and cloud platforms. His perspective spans research, production systems, and the realities of operating complex quantitative platforms at scale.\n.entry-content\n#post-##",

    "text": "Markets no longer move in cycles — they lurch in shocks. From tariff wars to flash crashes, the pace and scale of disruption are redefining how hedge funds compete.\nFirms that cling to legacy analytics stacks are stuck on defense. Those that unify real-time and historical data, backtest at tick-level depth, and iterate models in milliseconds are moving to offense, turning volatility into alpha.\nThis ebook, Switching to offense:\nHow KX helps hedge funds flip the playbook on volatility with high-performance analytics\nshows KX helps you:\n- Compress signal-to-strategy time with unified real-time and historical analytics.\n- Adapt models instantly to regime shifts and volatility clustering.\n- Detect model drift within 5 ms to protect live performance and prevent silent alpha decay.\n- Run 10× more backtests per week, increasing research throughput and idea velocity.\n- Cut infrastructure costs by up to 80% by consolidating streaming, historical, and simulation pipelines.\n\n### Why Read It\n\nVolatility defines today’s hedge-fund landscape. The firms that win are those that see through the chaos spotting opportunities as they form, not after they fade.\nWith KX powering your analytics, volatility turns from disruption into data: instantly measurable, modelable, and actionable.\n\n### Download your copy\n\n\"\n*\n\" indicates required fields\nPhoneThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.First

    "title": "Ashok Reddy on why temporal AI is the next frontier for capital markets",
    "text": "<br />\nIn this episode, Peter is joined by Ashok Reddy, our CEO, to unpack what it really means to compete in the real-time economy, and why most capital markets firms are still held back by infrastructure that can’t scale. Ashok explains how firms are redefining speed and adaptability, and why temporal AI may be the key to building systems that perceive, reason, and act across time.\nWhile excitement around AI has reached new heights, execution remains a sticking point. For many capital markets firms, progress is stalling, not because of a lack of vision, but because of infrastructure constraints. In this episode, Ashok Reddy and Peter Finter unpack what’s holding AI initiatives back, and what the most advanced firms are doing differently.\nAshok shares how KX customers, from bulge bracket banks to high-frequency crypto shops, are redefining what it means to operate at speed and scale. The key? Closing the latency gap between data, insight, and action. That means moving beyond static models and historical analysis, and embracing a new paradigm built on streaming data, adaptive algorithms, and what Ashok calls ‘\ntemporal AI\n.’\n\n## Key takeaways:\n\n\n### AI ambition is crashing into infrastructure limits\n\nThere’s no shortage of ambition when it comes to AI adoption. But many initiatives fail to scale because the infrastructure underneath can’t support the demands of real-time performance. Too often, firms try to take models that worked in isolated pilots and bolt them onto systems that were never designed to handle live data at production speed.\n“Everyone’s excited about pilots. But when you put those models into production, it’s like bolting a jet engine onto a go-kart. The architecture just can’t keep up.”\n– Ashok Reddy, CEO, KX\nFor decision-makers in capital markets, this isn’t just a technical problem, it’s a strategic one. When infrastructure can’t keep up, the best ideas stall before they create value.\n\n### Temporal AI brings foresight, not just speed\n\nTime-series analysis tells you what happened. Time-aware systems respond to what’s happening now. Temporal AI adds a missing layer: the ability to model change, infer momentum, and act in anticipation of future states.\n“Time series tells you what happened. Time-aware systems tell you what’s happening now. But temporal AI is about what’s next and what you should do about it.”\n– Ashok Reddy, CEO, KX\nIn high-volatility environments, backward-looking models often fail. Temporal AI gives data scientists and quants a way to build systems that evolve with the market, not just describe it after the fact.\n\n### Context is the real edge in real time\n\nRaw speed isn’t enough. Without context – why a change occurred, how it connects to other signals, and what the likely next move is – organizations can only react, not reason.\n“It’s not just about reacting fast. It’s about knowing what’s happening, why it’s happening, and what action to take right now. That’s how firms unlock alpha at scale.”​\n– Ashok Reddy, CEO, KX\nThe advantage comes from systems that don’t just deliver low-latency execution, but can interpret data with enough clarity to make the next best move instantly and automatically.\n\n### Bring compute to the data, or fall behind\n\nTraditional workflows involve collecting, cleaning, and shipping data to centralized environments before it can be analyzed. That’s too slow. Market leaders are flipping the model, bringing computation to the data instead of the other way around.\n“Why move data to your algorithms? Bring your compute to the data. That’s the only way to learn and act in real time. Data is the algorithm.”​\n– Ashok Reddy, CEO, KX\nWhen every millisecond counts, moving data introduces delay, cost, and complexity. Co-locating algorithms with data enables decisions to happen at the point of insight—faster, cheaper, and with less risk of information loss.\n\n### Start with outcomes, not AI experiments\n\nMany AI programs start with the technology and go looking for a problem. The ones that work do the opposite: they start with a specific outcome, then figure out how AI can improve the process behind it.\n“Start with the job to be done, like backtesting a portfolio faster or improving trade execution, and figure out how AI can make that better. Not the other way around.”​\n– Ashok Reddy, CEO, KX\nIf you’re leading AI strategy from the CDO or CIO office, this mindset shift is critical. Focus on where AI helps teams move faster, scale smarter, or act more accurately and bake it into existing decision workflows rather than building standalone tools.\n\n## Further reading:\n\n- Ashok’s Substack\n- Blog:From AI insights to AI-driven decisions: Accelerate innovation with temporal intelligence\n- Blog:Survival of the fastest: Why firms must break the AI ‘sound barrier’\nBe first in line to hear our next podcast by subscribing to ourYouTube channel,Apple Podcasts,Spotify,or your chosen podcast platform.

    "text": "You’ve cleaned the data, built the model, tuned the parameters. The signal is still flat. What next? In this episode of Data in the AI Era , Judith Gu, Head of Equities and FX Quant Trading Strategies at Scotiabank, joins Peter Finter to unpack a real-world modeling breakdown in high-frequency trading and explain what really matters when your models don’t work.\n\n## Episode overview\n\nIf you’ve ever built a pipeline that looked solid on paper but failed in production, this episode will hit home. Judith walks through her experience building predictive models for high-frequency FX returns. She used a rigorous modeling progression, including linear models, machine learning, and deep learning, supported by full tuning and feature analysis. None of the models performed better than the naïve benchmark.\nThe root problem wasn’t in model selection or parameter settings. The data itself had no predictive structure. Judith tested for autocorrelation and found the returns behaved like white noise. That finding reframed her entire approach. Instead of searching for the right model, she treated the data as a noisy signal and applied wavelet denoising to extract structure.\nVolatility, in contrast, showed more promise. It held structure and responded well to simpler models. Judith also highlights issues with time-based features in 24/5 markets. Encoding hour-of-day as a raw number can mislead models that don’t understand market context. Her solution involved circular encoding and session-aware features.\nThis is a case study in data diagnostics, signal testing, and model restraint. Judith’s experience shows what to do when complexity isn’t the answer and how to identify when the data itself needs closer inspection.\n\n## Key takeaways\n\n\n### 1. Clean data doesn’t guarantee useful results\n\nJudith discovered that her high-frequency return data had no autocorrelation and no learnable structure. It passed all conventional checks for cleanliness but offered no predictive value. This exposed a common trap in quant modeling. Just because data is well-formatted and complete doesn’t mean it contains signal. The only way to be sure is to test the statistical properties directly. If the data behaves like white noise, no model will make it useful.\n\n### 2. When models stall, check your data, not your algorithm\n\nJudith applied multiple model types, from simple regressions to advanced neural networks. None of them outperformed the baseline. The issue wasn’t the model, it was the input. All signs pointed to a lack of structure in the return series. This is a clear signal to stop tuning and start diagnosing. If every approach gives you the same weak output, you’re likely working with unlearnable data.\n\n### 3. Signal processing can help when standard tools fail\n\nTo address the lack of structure, Judith turned to wavelet denoising. This method separates a signal into different frequency components, helping to filter out noise and surface patterns. By applying this approach, she was able to transform the return series into something the model could learn from. In high-frequency environments where noise overwhelms signal, tools like wavelets can reveal structure that time-domain models miss.\n\n### 4. Volatility holds more structure than returns\n\nJudith found that volatility data was far more predictable than returns. Even simple models produced usable outputs. This difference reflects the nature of fast markets, where price direction is often reactive and noisy, but volatility clusters in observable patterns. If directional modeling fails, shifting focus to volatility can still yield valuable insights for execution, risk, or strategy.\n\n### 5. Time features need better treatment in continuous markets\n\nTime-based variables like hour-of-day can mislead models if encoded as plain numbers. In global markets with continuous trading, 23 and 0 might be adjacent in real time, but they are distant on a numerical scale. Judith addressed this by using circular encoding and defining trading sessions explicitly. If you’re modeling on streaming data, how you represent time can shape the model’s entire view of market behavior.\n\n## Technical highlights\n\n\n### Knowing when to stop modeling and recheck your assumptions\n\nYou’ve tried multiple models. The results don’t improve. Now what? Judith’s experience shows the importance of recognizing when model tuning is a dead end. If your models plateau early and consistently, it’s often a sign to pause and reassess your inputs. Knowing when to stop is as important as knowing where to start.\n\n### Benchmarking against a true naïve model in HFT\n\nJudith used a zero-drift, last-price benchmark to measure prediction accuracy. In high-frequency environments, this is a meaningful test. If your model can’t outperform this baseline, the added complexity likely isn’t justified. A rigorous benchmark prevents false confidence and provides a reality check before going live.\n\n### Reframing the problem with signal processing tools\n\nJudith didn’t just change techniques, she changed her lens. Instead of thinking about price prediction as a standard time-series task, she approached it as a signal processing problem. That shift unlocked access to tools like wavelet decomposition, which helped reveal structure that statistical models alone could not find.\n\n### Why models that work in equities often fail in FX\n\nJudith transitioned from equities to FX and quickly found that techniques she once relied on didn’t apply. FX trades 24 hours a day, responds to macroeconomic events, and behaves differently across time zones. Features that worked in fragmented equity markets broke down in FX. Every asset class has its own modeling logic. What works in one won’t automatically work in another.\nKeep an eye out for an upcoming blog where we will explore Judith’s discovery process with more depth.\nWant to learn more?
