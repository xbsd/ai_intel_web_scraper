    "title": "Duplicate Permutations Unaddressed",
    "text": "# Duplicate Permutations Unaddressed\n\n# Issue\r\nIn several locations across code.kx.com we deal with finding all permutations. e.x.\r\n- https://code.kx.com/q/learn/reading/strings/#its-more-fun-to-permute\r\n- https://code.kx.com/phrases/math/#permutations\r\n\r\nIn both of these cases, I find that duplicate permutations are just completely unaddressed. If we are dealing with a set, naturally there will be no problem with duplicates. But the phrasebook does not clearly specify that we are dealing with sets, and the reading room puzzle goes further to specify our input is a string (clearly not a set). Furthermore, even if we assume that we are dealing with permutations of a set, we should ensure that the official solutions we provide handle these in a standardized and expected manner. \r\n\r\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19809631/147801929-0721037e-2515-4017-9f67-1bbefb695f05.png)\r\n\r\nClearly this is not the case. \r\n\r\n# Solutions \r\nWe should either: \r\n1. Clarify that the solutions provided only deal with unique elements, and have undefined behaviour otherwise\r\n2. Standardize the solutions to remove all duplicates\r\n3. Standardize the solutions to enumerate all permutations, regardless of duplicates\r\n\r\nWe can also do any combination of these (e.x. solution (1) for phrasebook and (2) for the reading room problem).\r\n\r\n# My Contribution\r\nI believe solution 2 is the best option. A list of permutations with duplicates seems redundant and unnecessary. You might as well `distinct` the output, in which case we should do this in the solutions provided. I don't know if applying `distinct` is necessarily the best solution here, in fact I have little experience with q, but it seems the most straightforward solution.\r\n\r\n## Phrasebook\r\n- Before: `{(1 0#x){raze(1 rotate)scan'x,'y}/x}`\r\n- After: `{(1 0#x){distinct raze(1 rotate)scan'x,'y}/x}`\r\n\r\n## Reading room cats cradle solution 1\r\nThis solution is actually incomplete and incorrect which is a separate issue of its own that caused this entire investigation. I have done the best I can to fix the solution and will provide it as a PR after discussion of this ticket.\r\n- Before: `{x {flip[y]where x=sum y}[s;] s vs til\"j\"$s xexp s:count x}`, incorrect\r\n- After: `{distinct x @ b where all each (til c) in/:b:flip c vs til \"j\"$c xexp c:count x}`\r\n\r\n## Reading room cats cradle solution 2\r\n- Before: `{(1 0#x) {raze({raze reverse 0 1 _ x}\\)each x,'y}/ x}`, strongly based off the phrasebook solution\r\n- After: `{(1 0#x) {distinct raze({raze reverse 0 1 _ x}\\)each x,'y}/ x}`",

There is a definition and a mathematical clarification as to what the keyword does. There are no examples given. Only at the end of the first part is it mentioned that the keyword also works with tuples (that's the old word for a dictionary?) and table columns (which I think is misleading wording: a column is just a list, we're trying to say that it works on tables).\n- the second part tells you about what happens if you use it with a three-column table as the left argument. I don't think there's any reason it should be three, as far as I know, the keyword is more general than that. I think the wording is a bit on the technical side, but a good example can help massively. The example given though is wrong, as these are examples for the first part (list as the left argument). Also, interestingly, for \"not found\", the result here is 0N instead of -1, this is not documented.\n- the third part tells you about what happens if you use it with a three-column table as the left argument while the last column is sorted. Here, it makes more sense that it's three, as you need at least three columns to explain how the search works, but still, it doesn't only work with three. The example given is okay, as the result exactly the same as if the third column wasn't sorted, and only the performance aspect is relevant.",
