    "title": "jdbc driver returns no rows, just header",
    "text": "# jdbc driver returns no rows, just header\n\nI've been attempting to test the JDBC driver with a view to later useing it to integrate Alation Data catalog\r\nI set up the connection with the driver\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9961593/70746579-fe8afc80-1d1d-11ea-84ad-b09a8a74860b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nBut a query returns no rows... I can assure you that this definitely does return rows on a qpad/qstudio\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9961593/70745923-cb943900-1d1c-11ea-89e9-17f2e239f0dc.png)\r\n\r\ni can see from the logs the query it actually runs is as follows\r\n```\r\n .z.pg: ([]TABLE_TYPE:`TABLE`VIEW)^M\r\n.z.pg: {[maxRows;fetchSize;fn;args]$[not .Q.qt r:value[fn]args;::;count r:select[maxRows]from 0!r;{neg[.z.w]@/:-1_x;last x}(0N;fetchSize)#r;r]}[0;2147483647], .o.ex, q)select from trade^M\r\n```\r\n\r\nis there some property i should be supplying to the driver?\r\n\r\n\n\n## Top Comments\n\n**CharlieSkelton-Kx**: The trace is helpful. It shows that the application is setting max rows to 0, hence it is limiting the result set length to 0 rows.

    "title": "interfacing with C on linux problem",
    "text": "# interfacing with C on linux problem\n\nHello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to access kdb+ from within C code on a Linux (CentOS) machine, and have followed the instructions outlined in this document:\r\n\r\nhttps://code.kx.com/q/wp/c_api_for_kdb.pdf \r\n\r\nThe C code I`m using is like the one of page 4, just a simple khp/khpu to communicate with the port I set for q to listen on. (One difference is I'm using a slightly different compile command than given in that document, which is this: gcc -m32 -D KXVER=3 test.c c.o -o test -lpthread)\r\n\r\n I can compile my test.c code and it will run but gets stuck on the line calling the khp function. I have checked my system to see which ports are listening, and everytime I run my code it adds one byte to my RECV-Q (I take this to mean the receiving queue) on that port. It would seem as though kdb won't accept what's being communicated to it. Everything seems fine on the surface, I am getting no errors, but I am simply stuck here. \r\n\r\nAnyone know what might be causing this block in communication? \r\nThank you \n\n## Top Comments\n\n**sv**: Would you be able to provide a reproducer? C code as well as which version of kdb, how you start it and if any of handlers are redefined?\n\n---\n\n**sv**: You can get help quicker on our google group - https://groups.google.com/forum/?nomobile=true#!forum/personal-kdbplus\n\n---\n\n**Ch33m0**: Oh yes, I figured out the issue in the end! I was making a rookie mistake. Essentially I was opening up an instance of q, telling it to listen on a port, then just pressing ctrl-z to return to the bash terminal. This was keeping the q process alive, but sleeping it so it couldn't actually respond to communications. How I fixed this was to go to the folder where I run q and type : [$nohup ./q -p 5001 &] , and then press enter once. After this I was able to run my c code perfectly fine and all the outgoing q messages were handled as expected. Sorry to bother, many resources seem to omit details that can get a beginner caught up in some confusion",

        "**Ch33m0**: Oh yes, I figured out the issue in the end! I was making a rookie mistake. Essentially I was opening up an instance of q, telling it to listen on a port, then just pressing ctrl-z to return to the bash terminal. This was keeping the q process alive, but sleeping it so it couldn't actually respond to communications. How I fixed this was to go to the folder where I run q and type : [$nohup ./q -p 5001 &] , and then press enter once. After this I was able to run my c code perfectly fine and all the outgoing q messages were handled as expected. Sorry to bother, many resources seem to omit details that can get a beginner caught up in some confusion"
