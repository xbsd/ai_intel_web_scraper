    "text": "# Configuring the linter\n\nHey,\r\n\r\nI'm currently running VSCode 1.94.0, and 1.7.0 of the kdb extension.  I have the linter enabled in extension options, and I'm able to get issues appearing in the \"Problems\" tab, so that's all good.\r\n\r\nThe issue I have is I can't configure the linter.  I need to switch off some rules, like for example UNUSED_VAR.  So far I've tried commenting in files, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n// @qlintrule UNUSED_VAR : false\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut it seems to be ignoring these.  How can I configure linting?  Can I add a file, where should it be placed for it to pick it up etc.?\n\n## Top Comments\n\n**ecmel**: Hi, have you installed qlint https://code.kx.com/developer/libraries/  If installed extension will support it.\r\nCurrently the built in linter does not have any configuration options it is on or off.\r\n\n\n---\n\n**picoDoc**: ah right, so there's no way to configure the built in linter in the VSCode extension?  i.e. the Problems that appear like:\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed5278d2-c7bc-4031-a427-d535a42d6ff0)\r\n\r\nIs there any plan to add this as a feature?  I'm not so interested in having to run the linter manually outside of VSCode\n\n---\n\n**ecmel**: qlint is also well integrated with the extension if you prefer it. Regarding the built in linter we are planning to add support for more config options.",
