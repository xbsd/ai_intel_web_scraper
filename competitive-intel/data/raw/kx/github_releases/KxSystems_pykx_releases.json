This can provide two benefits:\r\na. Conversions of kx.List objects to NumPy by default produce an array of NumPy arrays rather than an N-Dimensional NumPy array. Setting reshape=True when handling N-Dimensional rectangular lists allows the shape to be pre-processed prior to conversion and a more natural N-Dimensional NumPy array to be generated.\r\n```python\r\n>>> kx.q('2 2#4?1f').np(reshape=True)\r\narray([[0.94997503, 0.43908099],\r\n       [0.57590514, 0.59190043]])\r\n```\r\n b. Provide a performance boost when converting regularly shaped (rectangular) N-Dimensional lists of uniform type when the shape of the resulting numpy array is known prior to conversion\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pykx as kx\r\n>>> lst = kx.q('100000 100 10#100000000?1f')\r\n>>> %timeit lst.np()\r\n9.72 s ± 272 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\r\n>>> %timeit lst.np(reshape=[100000, 100, 10])\r\n883ms ± 19.8 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loops each)\r\n```\r\n- Added async_response keyword argument when calling AsyncQConnection objects with reuse=False and wait=False to allow keeping the connection alive until an asynchronous response message has been received.\r\n\r\n:wrench: Fixes & Improvements :wrench:\r\n\r\n-  Application of the str function on empty PyKX objects could return unexpected results\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pykx as kx\r\n>>> str(kx.q('()!()'))\r\n'()!()'\r\n>>> str(kx.q('()'))\r\n'()'\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n- When a client attempted to retrieve an object which could not be serialized from a PyKX server it resulted in the client process hanging. An appropriate error is now sent to the client.\r\n- Database generation functionality now allows users to pass any data-type which will convert to a pykx.Table as the table parameter\r\n- Attempting to create a partitioned databases/add a partition to a database with a sym_enum keyword but no by_field would result in a KeyError.\r\n- Using math.inf or -math.inf when creating numeric values now creates equivalent PyKX types\r\n- Fixed a bug where QFuture objects returned by AsyncQConnection objects could block each other unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n🆕 Beta Features 🆕\r\n\r\nAddition of support in Beta form for conversions between PyKX and PyTorch objects.",

This functionality is outlined in-depth here.\r\n- Update to the PyKX Query API to support a significantly more Python first approach to querying kdb+ in-memory and on-disk databases.\r\n```python\r\n>>> table = kx.Table(data={\r\n...     'sym': kx.random.random(100, ['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'MSFT']),\r\n...     'date': kx.random.random(100, kx.q('2022.01.01') + [0,1,2]),\r\n...     'price': kx.random.random(100, 1000.0),\r\n...

See here for a worked example.\r\n- Two new options added on first initialisation of PyKX to allow users to:\r\n    - Use the path to their already downloaded kc.lic/k4.lic licenses without going through the “Do you want to install a license” workflow\r\n    - Allow users to persist for future use that they wish to use the IPC only unlicensed mode of PyKX, this will persist a file ~/.pykx-config which sets configuration denoting unlicensed mode is to be used.\r\n- Addition of function `kx.util.install_q` to allow users who do not have access to a q executable at the time of installing PyKX. See here for instructions regarding its use.\r\nAddition of function `kx.util.start_q_subprocess` to allow a q process to be started on a specified port with supplied initialisation arguments\r\n\r\n🔧  Fixes & Improvements 🔧 \r\n\r\nAs with any release PyKX 3.0 provides a significant number of bug fixes and improvements, the following are a subset:\r\n- Addition of support for help when interacting with q keywords and operators via PyKX\r\n- Previously loading pykx.q during q startup using QINIT or QHOME/q.q resulted in a segfault or a corruption.\r\n- The function `kx.util.debug_environment` now returns the applied configuration values at startup instead of customised values\r\n- Operations on `kx.GroupbyTable` objects which have been indexed previously would raise an error indicating invalid key access\r\n- Attempts to load a database using the `kx.DB` module previously would raise an nyi error if the path to the database contained a space",

Full release notes can be found [here](https://code.kx.com/pykx/2.5/release-notes/changelog.html#pykx-250).\r\n\r\n**Highlights:**\r\n\r\n- `table.xbar` , `table.window_join` , `table.replace`\r\n- Added `as_arrow` keyword to the `.pd()` method to use PyArrow backed data types rather than NumPy.\r\n- Other items of note:\r\n- PyKX can now be installed to locations with spaces in the file path.\r\n- Updated libq to 4.0 2024.05.07 and 4.1 to 2024.04.29 for all supported OS's.\r\n- IPC queries can now pass PyKX Functions like objects as the first query parameter.\r\n- k4.lic licenses can now be installed using the interactive license helper.\r\n- To ease license updates, If PyKX fails to start due to a license error it will attempt to replace it's license from `KDB_LICENSE_B64` or `KDB_K4LICENSE_B64` if you have one set.\r\n\r\nThe full list including more fixes and improvements is available [here](https://code.kx.com/pykx/2.5/release-notes/changelog.html#pykx-250).\r\n\r\n**Examples:**\r\n\r\n`table.window_join`\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> trades = kx.Table(data={\r\n...

This argument allows IPC connection to be automatically re-established when it is lost and a server has reinitialized.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pykx as kx\r\n>>> conn = kx.SyncQConnection(port = 5050, reconnection_attempts=4)\r\n>>> conn('1+1')    # Following this call the server on port 5050 was closed for 2 seconds\r\npykx.LongVector(pykx.q('2'))\r\n>>> conn('1+2')\r\nWARNING: Connection lost attempting to reconnect.\r\nFailed to reconnect, trying again in 0.5 seconds.\r\nFailed to reconnect, trying again in 1.0 seconds.\r\nConnection successfully reestablished.\r\npykx.LongAtom(pykx.q('3'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Added --reconnection_attempts option to Jupyter %%q magic making use of the above IPC logic changes.\r\n- Addition of environment variable/configuration value PYKX_QDEBUG which allows debugging backtrace to be displayed for all calls into q instead of requiring a user to specify debugging is enabled per-call. This additionally works for remote IPC calls and utilisation of Jupyter magic commands.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import os\r\n>>> os.environ['PYKX_QDEBUG'] = 'True'\r\n>>> import pykx as kx\r\n>>> kx.q('{x+1}', 'e')\r\nbacktrace:\r\n  [2]  {x+1}\r\n         ^\r\n  [1]  (.Q.trp)\r\n\r\n  [0]  {[pykxquery] .Q.trp[value; pykxquery; {if[y~();:(::)];2@\"backtrace:\r\n                    ^\r\n\",.Q.sbt y;'x}]}\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/usr/local/anaconda3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pykx/embedded_q.py\", line 230, in __call__\r\n    return factory(result, False)\r\n  File \"pykx/_wrappers.pyx\", line 493, in pykx._wrappers._factory\r\n  File \"pykx/_wrappers.pyx\", line 486, in pykx._wrappers.factory\r\npykx.exceptions.QError: type\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Fixes and Improvements:**\r\n\r\n- Resolved segfaults on Windows when PyKX calls Python functions under q.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pykx as kx\r\n>>> kx.q('{[f;x] f  x}', sum, kx.q('4 4#til 16'))\r\npykx.LongVector(pykx.q('24 28 32 36'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Updated kdb Insights Core libraries to 4.0.8, see [here](https://code.kx.com/insights/1.8/core/release-notes/latest.html#408) for more information.\r\n- Updated libq 4.0 version to 2024.03.04 for all supported OS’s.\r\n- Fix issue where use of valid C backed q code APIs could result in segmentation faults when called.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pykx as kx\r\n>>> isf = kx.q('.pykx.util.isf')\r\n>>> isf\r\npykx.Foreign(pykx.q('code'))\r\n>>> isf(True)\r\npykx.BooleanAtom(pykx.q('0b'))\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Each call to the PyKX query API interned 3 new unique symbols. This has now been removed.\r\n\r\n**Beta Features**\r\n\r\n- Addition of Compress and Encrypt classes to allow users to set global configuration and for usage within Database partition persistence.\r\n \r\n__Standalone__\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pykx as kx\r\n>>> compress = kx.Compress(algo=kx.CompressionAlgorithm.gzip, level=8)\r\n>>> kx.q.z.zd\r\npykx.Identity(pykx.q('::'))\r\n>>> compress.global_init()\r\npykx.LongVector(pykx.q('17 2 8'))\r\n>>> encrypt = kx.Encrypt(path='/path/to/the.key', password='PassWord')\r\n>>> encrypt.load_key()\r\n```\r\n\r\n__Database__\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import pykx as kx\r\n>>> compress = kx.Compress(algo=kx.CompressionAlgorithm.lz4hc, level=10)\r\n>>> db = kx.DB(path='/tmp/db')\r\n>>> db.create(kx.q('([]10?1f;10?1f)', 'tab', kx.q('2020.03m'), compress=compress)\r\n>>> kx.q('-21!`:/tmp/db/2020.03/tab/x')\r\npykx.Dictionary(pykx.q('\r\ncompressedLength  | 140\r\nuncompressedLength| 96\r\nalgorithm         | 4i\r\nlogicalBlockSize  | 17i\r\nzipLevel          | 10i\r\n'))\r\n```",
