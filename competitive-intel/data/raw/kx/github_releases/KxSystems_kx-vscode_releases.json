These files are identified with the extension `*.kdb.q` (for q) or `*.kdb.py` (for Python) and are created in `.kx` directory of the current workspace folder.\n  - A new **WORKBOOK** view displays the list of Workbooks per workspace.  \n- **Data sources** - Data sources can be associated with a specific connection rather than just running against the active connection. They are created in the `.kx` directory of the current workspace folder as `*.kdb.json` files.\n  -  A new **DATASOURCES** view displays the list of data sources per workspace.  \n- **Data Source Editor** - The data source editor visual design has been improved.\n- **OUTLINE** - A new OUTLINE view provides support for q and quke files.\n- **Command Grouping** - All extension commands are now grouped under the KX prefix.\n- **Syntax Highlighting** - The syntax highlighting for q and quke files has been improved.\n- **Connections Icons** - New status sensitive icons have been implemented for connections/\n- **q file icon** - New icon for q files.\n\n### Fixes\n\n- Inconsistent command descriptions have been fixed.\n- The Execute entire file button was only working when the code editor was selected. This is resolved.\n- Language server, parser and linter improvements.\n- Updated dependencies.\n\n### Internal Improvements\n\n- Corrected parser inconsistencies\n- Language server support for quke files\n- Improved query execution for Insights connections\n\n\n",
