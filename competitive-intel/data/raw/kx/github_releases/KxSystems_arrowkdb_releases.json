If the kdb string/symbol list contains more than this amount of data then it has to be populated into an Arrow chunked array.  Chunked arrays were already support by `arrowkdb` when writing Arrow IPC files or streams, but not when when writing Parquet files.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in order to support the used of chunked arrays when writing Parquet files, the `ARROW_CHUNK_ROWS` option has been added to:\r\n* pq.writeParquet\r\n* pq.writeParquetFromTable\r\n\r\nNote: This only applies to how kdb lists are chunked internally to the Parquet file writer.  This is different to the row groups configuration (set using `PARQUET_CHUNK_SIZE`) which controls how the Parquet file is structured when written.",

This data format has a rich datatype system (included nested data types) designed to support the needs of analytic database systems, dataframe libraries, and more.\r\n\r\nThe `arrowkdb` integration enables kdb+ users to read and write Arrow tables created from kdb+ data using:\r\n* Parquet file format\r\n* Arrow IPC record batch file format\r\n* Arrow IPC record batch stream format\r\n\r\nCurrently Arrow supports over 35 datatypes including concrete, parameterized and nested datatypes. Each Arrow datatype is mapped to a kdb+ type and `arrowkdb` can seamlessly convert between both representations.\r\n\r\nSeparate APIs are provided where the Arrow table is either created from a kdb+ table using an inferred schema or from an Arrow schema and the table’s list of array data.\r\n* Inferred schemas.  If you are less familiar with Arrow or do not wish to use the more complex or nested Arrow datatypes, `arrowkdb` can infer the schema from a kdb+ table where each column in the table is mapped to a field in the schema.\r\n* Constructed schemas.  Although inferred schemas are easy to use, they support only a subset of the Arrow datatypes and are considerably less flexible.  Where more complex schemas are required then these should be manually constructed using the datatype/field/schema constructor functions which `arrowkdb` exposes, similar to the C++ Arrow library and PyArrow.\r\n",
