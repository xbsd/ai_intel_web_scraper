## Common Cross-Cutting Objections to Address

1. **"But {competitor_name} is free/open source"** — Address the TCO argument, hidden costs of DIY, missing enterprise features, engineering time.

2. **"But {competitor_name} uses standard SQL"** — Address the learning curve concern, explain what q/KDB+ provides that SQL cannot, mention PostgreSQL wire protocol support in KDB-X.

3. **"We don't need that level of performance"** — Address why sub-millisecond matters even if they think it doesn't today, growth scenarios, real-time risk requirements.

4. **"{competitor_name} is easier to hire for"** — Address the talent argument, PyKX, training programs, developer experience improvements.

5. **"We're already using {competitor_name} for other workloads"** — Address the consolidation argument, when specialization wins.

For each objection, provide:
- The exact objection phrasing (as a prospect would say it)
- A recommended response (consultative, not defensive)
- Supporting evidence from the sources (with URLs)
